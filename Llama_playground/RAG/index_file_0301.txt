What is the impact of the war on Israeli lives and businesses?

At 2024-jan-25, the war has caused a slowdown in the Israeli economy, with shoppers staying at home, investors stalling their visits, concerts being cancelled, and crops going unharvested. The tourist industry has collapsed overnight, and the war has reduced swaths of the Gaza territory to rubble, displaced 1.8 million people, and killed more than 25,000 Palestinians. The sector has lost 10% of its employees, and many Israelis were forced to give up work to care for children. The war has also caused immense hardship in the occupied West Bank.
