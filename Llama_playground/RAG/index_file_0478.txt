What is behind Germany's support for Israel's war against Hamas?

At 2023-nov-28, germany's foreign policy establishment has suffered a deep shock after last year's realisation that Russia could not be appeased by diplomatic overtures, pipeline deals and "change through trade". Similarly, Germany had pushed for diplomacy to deal with Iran's nuclear and regional ambitions. Engagement with Russia and Iran has failed. This is the view from Berlin: these two powers must be stopped, and that includes the destruction of Hamas. This is the reason for Germany's staunch support of Israel's war against Hamas, notwithstanding the deep distrust of Netanyahu - and the wish to see him gone as soon as hostilities end.
