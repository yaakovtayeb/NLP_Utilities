What happened during the Houthi drone attack in the Red Sea and what were the consequences? 

At 2024-jan-10, the Houthi rebels launched their most sophisticated attack yet with 18 drones and 3 missiles targeting a fleet of warships in the Red Sea. Although they were all shot down, the attack was not lost on western politicians. The US, UK and 10 other mostly western nations told Yemen’s Houthi rebels that they would “bear the consequences” if they launched further attacks on merchant shipping in the southern Red Sea. Antony Blinken, the US secretary of state, on a trip to Bahrain, said on Wednesday: “If this continues, as it did yesterday, there will be consequences.” In Britain, the defence secretary, Grant Shapps, said “watch this space” and warned the current situation “cannot continue”.
