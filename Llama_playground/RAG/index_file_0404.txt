What is the current situation in Gaza according to the UN? 

At 2023-dec-21, the UN has declared a "catastrophic" hunger crisis of unprecedented proportions in Gaza, with everyone in the besieged coastal strip liable to face acute food insecurity in the coming weeks. Four out of five households in the north of Gaza, and half of those displaced in the south, were enduring days without any food. By 7 February, about 50% of the population are forecast to be in the "emergency" phase, defined as very high acute malnutrition and excess mortality.
