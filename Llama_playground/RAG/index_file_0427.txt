What happened in the massacre in Ardamata, Sudan?

At 2023-dec-15, on November 5, 2020, fighters from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and allied Arab militia went house to house in Ardamata, a suburb of El Geneina, the capital of Sudanâ€™s West Darfur region, in a frenzy of killing. The gunmen mostly sought out men and teenage boys from the Masalit community, an African ethnic group, accusing them of being fighters and harbouring weapons. The UN says more than 800 people were killed, and the massacre was part of a wide ethnic-cleansing campaign conducted by the RSF with the aim to eradicate the non-Arab Masalit community from West Darfur.
