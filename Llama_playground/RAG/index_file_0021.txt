What is the current situation in Rafah and what are the potential consequences of an Israeli incursion in the area?

At 2024-may-03, the UN warns that an Israeli incursion in Rafah would put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians at risk and be a huge blow to the humanitarian operations of the Gaza Strip. Aid operations run from Rafah include medical clinics and food distribution points, including centres for malnourished children. The World Health Organization (WHO) has prepared a contingency plan for an incursion, which includes a new field hospital, but said it would not be enough to prevent a substantial rise in the death toll. The UK also imposed sanctions on two “extremist” groups and four individuals in Israel who it blamed for violence in the West Bank.
