What has happened to the dreams of African migrants hoping to start a new life in Europe through Tunisia?

At 2023-nov-09, the dreams of African migrants hoping to start a new life in Europe through Tunisia have turned into a nightmare due to a recent crackdown by Tunisian authorities on small-boat crossings, leaving many stranded and unable to make it out. The harrowing journey to Tunisia has also destroyed the physical and mental health of many migrants, with some facing hunger, abuse, and bandits who robbed and raped them. The tightening restrictions have encouraged many immigrants to stay in Tunisia, with the numbers of asylum seekers rising.
