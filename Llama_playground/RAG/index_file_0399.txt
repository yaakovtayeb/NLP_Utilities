What is the current status of the UN resolution aimed at increasing aid into Gaza and what concerns does the US have about it?

At 2023-dec-21, the UN resolution on Gaza's aid delivery remains stalled and has been delayed until Friday. The US has voiced concerns about the text's references to a cessation of hostilities in the war as well as the key sticking point - the inspection of aid trucks entering into Gaza to ensure they are only carrying humanitarian goods. The US is still not satisfied with the latest draft.
