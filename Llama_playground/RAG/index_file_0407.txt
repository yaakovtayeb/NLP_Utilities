What is the current situation regarding negotiations for a new Gaza ceasefire and the release of more Israeli hostages?

At 2023-dec-20, the US has said that "very serious" negotiations are taking place in Egypt, but prospects for a deal remain uncertain as Hamas reportedly insisted it would not discuss anything less than a complete end to Israelâ€™s offensive in the Palestinian territory. Hamas leaders' arrival in Egypt suggests a second hostage deal is imminent.
