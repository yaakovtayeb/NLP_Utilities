What is the plan drawn up by a coalition of charities and groups for the UK to provide refuge to thousands of Palestinians from Gaza?

At 2023-oct-23, the plan is for the UK to introduce an emergency family reunion scheme, carry out a medical evacuation for people in need of specialist care, prioritise cases of Palestinians and Israelis already in the UK asylum system, and facilitate travel for UK nationals and those with the right to enter the UK.
