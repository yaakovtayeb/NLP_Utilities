What is the current atmosphere in Israel regarding free speech and expressing sympathy for Palestine?

At 2023-oct-22, there is an atmosphere of fear in Israel where people are being detained, fired from their jobs, and even attacked for expressing sentiments interpreted by some as showing sympathy for Hamas after the group’s murderous attack on 7 October. The crackdown is directed primarily by the government of Benjamin Netanyahu. Protests in sympathy with Gaza have been dispersed with force and Israel’s chief of police, Yaakov Shabtai, said last week: “Anyone who wants to identify with Gaza is welcome. I will put them on buses now that are headed there and I will help him get there.”
