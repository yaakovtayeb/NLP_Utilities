What is China's stance on the Israel-Palestine conflict and how is it trying to influence the situation?

China has been a long-time supporter of the Palestinians and has called for a two-state solution, but it is also presenting itself as a neutral party that holds steadfast to a non-interference principle. It has called for a global peace conference and a ceasefire to avoid a humanitarian crisis. China has sent a Middle East special envoy to the region and has been trying to use its acquired influence to prevent further escalation of the conflict. However, analysts say that China still doesn't have strong enough influence in the region to effect a real solution. The issue also allows China to push back on ongoing accusations about its own human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in Xinjiang.
