What is the US position on Israel's military campaign in Gaza and its postwar plans?

At 2023-nov-16, the US has provided public support for Israel's military campaign in Gaza but tensions are escalating behind the scenes, and issues around the Israeli strategy are unresolved. The US seems unhappy with what it is hearing of Israel's postwar plans. In an interview with the Financial Times, the Israeli president, Isaac Herzog, insisted Israel could not leave a vacuum in Gaza and that this would require a very strong Israeli presence. As he was saying this, Biden was reiterating that an Israeli re-occupation of Gaza would be a very big mistake.
