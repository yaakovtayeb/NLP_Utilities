What is the current situation on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, and what is the likelihood of a full-blown conflict?

At 2023-nov-02, tensions have risen on Israel's northern border with Lebanon, with exchanges between the Israel Defence Forces (IDF) and Hezbollah and other armed factions in Lebanon becoming a daily fact of life. While some analysts suggest that Hezbollah is keen to signal that it is engaged at a low level, it does not want to escalate to a full-blown conflict, amid opposition to war from a large section of Lebanese society already battered by economic and political crisis. However, the scope of the clashes has spread in recent weeks, leading to fears that a single incident could tip the confrontation into something more serious.
