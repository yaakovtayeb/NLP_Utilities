What was the result of the Iranian attack on Israel and what are the internal dynamics in Tehran?

At 2024-apr-15, iran claimed that the operation was successful, destroying an Israeli intelligence center close to the Syrian border and an airbase. Chief of the general staff Gen Mohammad Bagheri said that the operation was “over and there is no intention to continue it”. Lawmakers in Tehran have shifted to the conservative end of the spectrum, and all centers of power in Iran are completely dominated by conservatives, meaning that there are fewer people in the room arguing for options that are less escalatory.
