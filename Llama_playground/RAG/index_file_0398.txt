What is the estimated number of minors who have been killed or wounded in the Gaza conflict, and how does it compare to previous conflicts?

At 2023-dec-22, according to Unicef, minors account for at least 40% of the estimated 20,000 people killed so far in the Gaza conflict. In previous conflicts, the rate was about 20%, so the number of children who have been killed and injured is twice as high as before.
