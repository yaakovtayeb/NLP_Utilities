What is the current state of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza and what can be done to address it?

At 2023-oct-30, the current state of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza is dire, with millions of people in need of life-saving help due to the lack of food, water, and medical assistance. Immediate relief efforts are inadequate, and hunger and disease could soon cause more deaths than the bombing. To address this crisis, an effective response from the international community is needed, starting with a humanitarian resolution in the UN Security Council. Plans must also be made for a massive expansion of aid beyond the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza, and an emergency financing conference should be held to ensure the response is fully funded. The aid agencies can then organize the thousands of workers, hundreds of trucks, and thousands of tonnes of supplies needed in Gaza day after day, week after week.
