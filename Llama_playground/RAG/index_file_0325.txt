What is the current state of health services in Gaza and the impact of the war on the medical facilities and patients?

At 2024-jan-19, health services in Gaza are decimated, with medical staff exhausted after three months of war. Tens of thousands in Gaza with chronic life-threatening illnesses have gone without treatment for months, and are now “without defences”, their bodies’ weakened by malnutrition, cold and fatigue, doctors say. Of the 36 hospitals in Gaza only 15 remain open, and only three are undamaged. 350,000 people in Gaza have chronic diseases and lack almost all medication. Disease is also spreading fast in the crowded, unsanitary conditions.
