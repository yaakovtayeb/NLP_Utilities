What is the new hijab bill approved by Iran's parliament and what are the consequences for women who defy it?

At 2023-sep-20, the new hijab bill approved by Iran's parliament requires women to follow the mandatory hijab rules and imposes harsh penalties on those who defy it. Women who continue to defy the dress code can face up to 10 years in prison. The bill also intends to identify those who "promote nudity [or] indecency" or "mock" the rules in a virtual or non-virtual space. The bill will require final approval from Iranâ€™s Guardian Council, a powerful body that vets legislation and oversees elections.
