What is the issue that Joe Biden is facing with Benjamin Netanyahu and what is Biden's role in the ongoing conflict in Gaza?

At 2023-dec-06, joe Biden is facing a problem with Benjamin Netanyahu as he is struggling to control the ongoing conflict in Gaza. Thousands of Palestinian lives are at stake and the hopes of stopping this war from spreading beyond Gaza are also at risk. Biden has the potential leverage and clout to rein in Netanyahu where European and Arab leaders do not. Biden proposed $14bn in military aid, deployed aircraft carrier battlegroups, and flew to Tel Aviv. His moving speech to a grieving nation offered the sort of solace and empathy wholly foreign to Netanyahu. Yet, after initially doubting the sheer scale of the carnage, Biden has slowly adjusted his stance, issuing increasingly strongly worded calls for proportionality, access for humanitarian assistance, and respect for international law.
