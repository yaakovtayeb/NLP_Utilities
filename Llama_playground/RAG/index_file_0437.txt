What is the latest warning from the US special envoy for global food security, Cary Fowler, at Cop28? 

Fowler warned that farming and food production around the world will suffer severe impacts from the climate crisis even if the world does manage to hold global temperature rises to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. He added that temperature rises will affect all aspects of food production, and more research is needed into how to make food crops more resilient to extreme weather. Fowler also expressed concern about poor diets, especially in parts of Africa, where childhood stunting impacts about a third of children, which is storing up massive problems for their future mental development and the fate of those countries.
