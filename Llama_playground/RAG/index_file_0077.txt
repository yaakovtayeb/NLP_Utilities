What is Israel's deterrent policy and how has it been affected by recent events?

At 2024-apr-15, israel's deterrent policy refers to military policies and the deployment of soft and hard power to persuade enemies that an attack is not worth it. Recent events, including the weekend attack by Iran, the Hamas attack on October 7th, and the conflict with Hezbollah on Israel's northern border, have weakened Israel's deterrence policy, according to analysts and former Israeli officials. The opposition leader, Yair Lapid, has stated that the Netanyahu government has become an existential threat to Israel and has shattered Israeli deterrence.
