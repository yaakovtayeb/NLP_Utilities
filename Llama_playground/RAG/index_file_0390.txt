What is the significance of military service in Israeli society?

At 2023-dec-29, military conscription is a unifying cornerstone in Israeli society, with 69% of men and 56% of women being conscripted for service at 18. It serves as a gateway to a complete Israeli identity, bridging all strata of the social hierarchy, and is considered a way into society, where jobs are advertised for “post-army” folks, where social clout is measured by your achievements in the military, and where casual conversations invariably drift to “where did you serve?”
