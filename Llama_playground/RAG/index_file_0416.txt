What is the current status of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and what challenges is Israel facing in defeating Hamas?

At 2023-dec-16, israel is struggling to defeat Hamas, despite claiming to have killed thousands of militants and taking control of areas in the Gaza Strip. Hamas is still engaging in close-quarters combat and ambushes, as well as firing rockets on a daily basis. The effectiveness of individual Hamas units and their connection to the central command is a more useful metric than the number of militants killed. Hamas is a flexible entity that combines characteristics of a ruling party, an underground organization, and a charitable fund, making it difficult to defeat. Hamas's extensive tunnel system is one of its key military assets, and Israel has yet to develop an organized combat doctrine to address it.
