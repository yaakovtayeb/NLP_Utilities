What is the reason behind the delay in US arms shipments to Israel?

At 2024-may-08, the US officials have signaled to Israel that more arms shipments could be delayed if the Israeli military pushes ahead with an offensive in Rafah, Gaza, in what would mark the start of a major pivot in relations between the two countries. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, confirmed that the Biden administration had paused the supply of thousands of large bombs to Israel, in opposition to apparent moves by the Israelis to invade the city.
