What caused the surge in gun license applications in Israel? 

At 2023-oct-30, the surge in gun license applications in Israel was caused by the unprecedented attack by Hamas militants on a string of Israeli towns near the Gaza border on 7 October that killed at least 1,400 Israelis. Growing numbers of Israelis have applied for a gun license or rushed to buy a gun, citing a sense of unease and feeling a need to take matters of defense into their own hands.
