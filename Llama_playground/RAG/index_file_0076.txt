What is the current situation in Gaza in terms of hunger and malnutrition among children?

At 2024-apr-15, hunger and malnutrition have already claimed an estimated 27 young lives in Gaza, and more children are at risk of starvation. Malnutrition is spreading at a record pace among children, with more than 90% of young children and pregnant and breastfeeding women subsisting on two or fewer food groups. The UN-backed food insecurity experts assessed in mid-March that famine in Gaza could set in between later that month and mid-May. Last week, Samantha Power, the head of the US humanitarian and development agency, USAid, became the first American official to confirm publicly that in some areas, famine had already taken hold.
