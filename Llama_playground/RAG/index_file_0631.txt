What caused the water crisis in Gaza and what are the consequences of it?

At 2023-oct-25, the water crisis in Gaza was caused by a combination of factors including over-abstraction of the coastal aquifer, contamination of the water with seawater, wastewater and agricultural runoff, and underdevelopment of water infrastructure. The repeated devastation caused by Israeli bombing and embargos on the materials needed to rebuild have left Gaza with a barely functioning piped water network. The consequences of this crisis include people trying to subsist on just three litres of water a day for all purposes, urinating once a day or less, and the rise of diseases such as chickenpox, scabies, and diarrhea due to poor sanitation conditions and consumption of water from unsafe sources.
