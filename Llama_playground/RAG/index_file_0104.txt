What is the reason behind the Royal Navy's deployment and the UK's increased aid to Gaza?

At 2024-apr-06, the Royal Navy was deployed to help supply aid to Gaza as the Palestinian people were on the brink of famine. The UK increased its support for a maritime corridor from Cyprus to Gaza to channel "life-saving aid" by sea to the population in urgent need of basic food supplies.
