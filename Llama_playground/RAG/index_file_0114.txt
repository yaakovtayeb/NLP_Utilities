What was the outcome of the Israeli investigation into the drone strikes on World Central Kitchen's vehicles in Gaza? 

At 2024-apr-05, the Israeli investigation blamed a series of "grave errors" by military personnel, including lack of coordination and misidentification, for the drone strikes that killed seven aid workers. Two middle-ranking officers were dismissed and a general was reprimanded. World Central Kitchen rejected the findings and called for a full and independent investigation. The UN secretary general also called for independent investigations and meaningful and measurable changes on the ground.
