What is the controversy surrounding Keir Starmer's response to the situation in Gaza and how has it affected Labour's support?

At 2023-oct-30, keir Starmer's response to the situation in Gaza, where he said that Israel had the right to besiege Gaza, has caused controversy and led to some Labour voters resigning from the party. This has also caused high-profile Labour figures to break ranks and call for a ceasefire. The consistency in the position of several Labour voters is that they will not vote for the party due to its position on Gaza, and this has led to concerns about the party's support and its ability to win elections.
