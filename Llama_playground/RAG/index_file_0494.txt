What is the United Arab Emirates' record on free speech and why is the UK government reviewing RedBird IMI's potential takeover of the Telegraph and the Spectator?

At 2023-nov-24, the United Arab Emirates has a mixed record on free speech with detention of journalists being common. RedBird IMI, an investment consortium led by Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, is looking to take control of the Telegraph and the Spectator. The UK government is reviewing the potential takeover due to concerns over public interest, editorial independence, and plurality of views.
