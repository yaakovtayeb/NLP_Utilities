What is the situation in Gaza during the celebration of Eid al-Fitr?

At 2024-apr-10, the celebration of Eid al-Fitr in Gaza is taking place in the shadow of war. The continuing Israeli offensive has caused damage to mosques and hospitals, leaving many homeless and without basic necessities. The lack of a beautiful atmosphere and the loss of loved ones due to the war has made it difficult for people to celebrate.
