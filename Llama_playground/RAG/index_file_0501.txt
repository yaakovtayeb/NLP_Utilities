What is the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) saying about the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza?

At 2023-nov-21, the CPJ says that Israelâ€™s military offensive in Gaza has produced the deadliest month for journalists since statistics began more than three decades ago, and created a news blackout in the embattled territory. The committee had already labelled the first month after the Hamas attacks as the most lethal suffered by journalists since 1992 before six more Palestinian journalists were killed in Gaza over the weekend.
