What was the outcome of the UN security council's resolution calling for humanitarian corridors into Gaza, and why did the US veto it?

At 2023-oct-18, the US vetoed a UN security council resolution calling for Israel to allow humanitarian corridors into Gaza, a pause in the fighting and the lifting of an order for civilians to leave the north of the besieged territory. The resolution was supported by 12 of the 15 members of the security council but failed to pass due to the US veto. The US ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, said the resolution was unacceptable because it made no mention of Israelâ€™s right to self-defence.
