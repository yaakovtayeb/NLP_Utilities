What is the risk of a broader war in the Middle East, and why is the Biden administration under pressure to strike back against Iran and its Houthi partner?

The pressure is mounting on the Biden administration to strike back against Iran and its Houthi partner to stop these attacks, as advocates of striking back hard think this will deter a larger war.
