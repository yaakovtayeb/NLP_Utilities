What happened at Columbia University with regards to pro-Palestinian student protesters?

At 2024-apr-30, pro-Palestinian student protesters took over an academic building at Columbia University and have been encamped on school property for two weeks. The university issued an ultimatum to abandon their encampment or risk suspension, and dozens of protesters took over Hamilton Hall, an academic building on the New York campus, barricading the entrances and unfurling a Palestinian flag out of a window. The police entered the university in an effort to disperse the students who took over the building and are facing expulsion.
