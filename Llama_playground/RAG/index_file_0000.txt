What is the current situation in Rafah, Gaza, and how is it impacting the medical facilities and patients in the area?

At 2024-may-08, hospitals in Rafah are at risk of being overwhelmed due to a wave of sick and injured people, and the situation is catastrophic. The Israeli army seized the nearby border crossing with Egypt in a dawn raid, and with the seizure of Rafah, Israel now controls all of Gaza’s crossings for the first time since it withdrew troops and settlers from the territory nearly two decades ago. The Rafah crossing is the only place where people can enter and exit. The continued fighting and closure of the crossings could cause the collapse of aid operations and a humanitarian catastrophe. Only a third of Gaza’s 36 hospitals and primary health care centres are working and all face acute shortages of medicine, basic medical supplies, fuel and manpower. The situation is very bad, and there are fears for increasing numbers suffering from widespread outbreaks of hepatitis and gastroenteritis, a consequence of overcrowding, insanitary conditions and rising temperatures as summer approaches. The main maternity hospital in Rafah has now been forced to stop admitting patients.
