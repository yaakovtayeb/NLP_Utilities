What is the reason behind the criticism of Benjamin Netanyahu's handling of relations with the US administration?

At 2024-mar-26, benjamin Netanyahu's handling of relations with the Biden administration has been criticized by Israeli commentators after the US abstention from vetoing a ceasefire resolution at the UN security council. Netanyahu's growing friction with the US president, Joe Biden, and his decision to cancel a visit by a delegation to the US after the vote were seen as "delusional", "madness", and "terrifying" by some Israeli media commentators. The criticism comes amid warnings that unanimous passage of the UN security council ceasefire resolution, with the US abstention, presages stronger moves against Israel amid growing calls for further sanctions and restrictions on arms transfers.
