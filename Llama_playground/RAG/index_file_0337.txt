What was the South Africa vs Israel case at the International Court of Justice about?

At 2024-jan-15, the case was about Israel's assault on Gaza, but at its heart, it was about closing the gap between Palestinian reality and how the dominant political forces describe it. The case challenged the portrayal of Palestine as fringe and presented evidence of the severity of events, including 6,000 bombs a week in the first three weeks of the conflict, 2,000lb bombs deployed at least 200 times, 85% of Gazans displaced, and 93% of the population facing crisis levels of hunger. It matters less what the final ruling is than that the case was made in the first place.
