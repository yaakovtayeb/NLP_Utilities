What is the current state of the conflict between Israel and Hamas?
The conflict is currently paused, but it is not over. There have been four days of quiet promised between Israel and Hamas, and there has been an exchange of hostages held in Gaza for prisoners held in Israel. However, even if the ceasefire is extended, this war is likely to intensify as it is too big to stop now and has already turned Israel upside down.
