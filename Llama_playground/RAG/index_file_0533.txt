What is happening at al-Shifa hospital in Gaza City and why are medics and aid workers warning patients will die?

At 2023-nov-12, the hospital was “totally surrounded and bombardments are going on nearby”, its director, Mohammad Abu Salmiya, said in a statement late on Saturday. The fierce clashes over recent days have trapped thousands of sick, wounded and displaced people in al-Shifa with no electricity and dwindling supplies. Medics and aid workers have warned patients will die unless there is a pause in the battle.
