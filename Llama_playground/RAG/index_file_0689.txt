What is the risk for dissidents traveling through Dubai, and why are they vulnerable to detention? 

At 2023-oct-16, dissidents traveling through Dubai are at risk of detention due to the country's laws that criminalize freedom of expression, association, and assembly. Dubai has been enabling a series of high-profile detentions of activists and dissidents from authoritarian regimes allied to the UAE government. The UAE works closely with other regional allies that are also intolerant to free expression and activism, so thereâ€™s a documented history of forcibly extraditing dissidents back to countries that seek them.
