What is the current situation of Bahzad Al-Akhras and his family in Rafah, Gaza due to the Israeli airstrikes?

At 2024-feb-15, bahzad Al-Akhras and his family are refugees in Rafah, living in worst conditions imaginable, waiting in queues for drinkable water, food, and plain flour to make bread over a fire, after months without electricity. They are frozen, living in fear, hopelessness, and emotional numbness. They lost their home in Khan Younis due to Israeli airstrikes and are now living in a thin tent that won't protect them from shrapnel. They fear that the warnings by Israel are laying the groundwork for what is to come.
