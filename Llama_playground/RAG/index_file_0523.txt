What is happening in Gaza and why are people leaving?

At 2023-nov-15, israeli troops are watching as Gaza residents join a slow march south to leave the area due to the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas. The IDF has established "humanitarian corridors" to allow residents to leave the north of Gaza, which is the main battle-zone, for the relative safety of the southern half of the territory. More than 11,000 in Gaza have been killed, of whom about 40% were under 18, according to Hamas-run health authorities.
