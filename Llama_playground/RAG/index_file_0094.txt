What is the US doing to deter Iran from carrying out a retaliatory strike against Israel and what will be the consequences if Iran does strike Israel directly?

At 2024-apr-11, the US is making concerted declarations of commitment to Israeli security to deter Iran from carrying out a retaliatory strike against Israel. US officials still believe that a direct Iranian missile or drone strike is possible within the next few days. If Iran does strike Israel directly, the US is likely to urge caution in Israelâ€™s response, in an effort to forestall an uncontrollable escalation into a conflict that could draw in the considerable US forces in the region.
