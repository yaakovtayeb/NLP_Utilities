What is the current situation in Gaza amid the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and Hamas?

At 2023-dec-06, israeli forces and Hamas are fighting house-to-house battles along the length of the Gaza Strip, resulting in devastating consequences for the civilian population and a complete collapse in humanitarian relief. The UN secretary general, António Guterres, has warned that the conflict “may aggravate existing threats to international peace and security”. The Hamas-run Gaza health ministry said 1,207 Palestinians had been killed since the collapse of a temporary ceasefire at the beginning of the month, and that 70% of the dead were women and children.
