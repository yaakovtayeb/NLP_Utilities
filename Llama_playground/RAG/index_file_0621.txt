What is the urgent intervention that the two British MPs are making regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict?

At 2023-oct-27, the two British MPs, Layla Moran and Alex Sobel, are making an urgent intervention to call for support from their friends abroad and their own communities in the UK that are affected by the conflict. They are concerned about the lack of space for nuance in parliament and in wider society on this issue and are working to build consensus around clear calls to action in the short term, as well as longer-term plans.
