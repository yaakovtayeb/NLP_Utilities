What is the current state of the conflict in Gaza and how has it been received by the international community?

At 2024-mar-25, the conflict in Gaza has been ongoing for almost six months, resulting in a high number of civilian casualties and the potential for a severe famine. However, despite warnings from human rights organizations and aid workers, support for Israel's offensive remains strong among its underwriters. The issue has been largely ignored by politicians and the mainstream media, leading to a sense of fatigue and desensitization among the public.
