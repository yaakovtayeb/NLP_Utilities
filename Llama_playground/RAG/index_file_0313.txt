What is the reason behind the recent bombing of Yemen by the UK and US?

At 2024-jan-23, the recent bombing of Yemen by the UK and US was conducted in an attempt to halt a string of missile, drone and small-boat attacks mounted by the Houthi rebel group against international shipping in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, through which an estimated 15% of world seaborne trade passes. The Houthis say their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea, which began in mid-October, are in support of Gaza.
