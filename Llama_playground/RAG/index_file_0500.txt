What is happening in West Darfur and who is responsible for the violence?

At 2023-nov-21, there is a genocide going on in West Darfur, where the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) fighters are rounding up and killing people from the Masalit ethnic group. The RSF, led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, has been fighting Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) forces loyal to General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan since 15 April, when the two leaders began a tussle for power that again toppled Sudan into a civil war. The UN says more than 9,000 people have been killed and 5.6 million displaced in the past seven months.
