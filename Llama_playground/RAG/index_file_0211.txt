What is the current status of the ceasefire negotiations between Israel and Hamas?

At 2024-feb-27, israeli and Hamas officials have downplayed hopes expressed by Joe Biden that a ceasefire in the war in Gaza is imminent, raising questions about whether a temporary truce can be implemented before the Muslim holy month of Ramadan begins in two weeks’ time. Hamas has not yet formally received a new proposal for a ceasefire since last week’s indirect talks in Paris mediated by the US, Egypt, and Qatar. The latest proposal under review reportedly includes a 40-day pause in all military operations, as well as the exchange of Palestinian prisoners for Israeli hostages at a ratio of 10 to one.
