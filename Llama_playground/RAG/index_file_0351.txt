What is the UN Security Council's resolution on the attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, and what is the response from the US and its allies?

At 2024-jan-11, the UN Security Council has adopted a resolution calling for an immediate end to attacks by Yemen's Houthi rebels on shipping in the Red Sea, and called on the Houthis to release the Galaxy Leader, a Japanese-operated vehicle carrier linked to an Israeli businessman that the group commandeered on 19 November, along with its 25 crew. The US and its allies have warned that further attacks could prompt a western military response, and have endorsed Operation Prosperity Guardian, a US-led multinational naval taskforce that has been defending commercial ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden from Houthi missile and drone attacks.
