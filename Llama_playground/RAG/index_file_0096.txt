What is the status of the proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement between Hamas and Israel?

At 2024-apr-11, hamas has indicated that it does not have 40 captives who meet the “humanitarian” criteria for the proposed hostages-for-prisoners ceasefire agreement with Israel. Ceasefire talks have focused on a US-backed proposal of a phased exchange of hostages and prisoners. In the first instance, women, children, and elderly or sick people would be exchanged for an estimated 900 Palestinian prisoners being held by Israel, alongside a six-week ceasefire in Gaza. However, reliable information about how many hostages remain alive, who is holding them, and where has been hard to come by. The talks have brought no signs of a breakthrough on a plan presented by US, Qatari, and Egyptian mediators, which Hamas said it was studying.
