Why do many Israelis believe that Netanyahu must go?

At 2023-nov-05, many Israelis believe that Netanyahu must go because of his refusal to apologize for security and intelligence mistakes on his watch, and his poor handling of the aftermath of the Hamas massacres and the new war in the Gaza Strip. Netanyahu's polling numbers are abysmal, and his support has fallen to an overall 3.9 out of 10, according to research by Reichman Universityâ€™s Institute for Liberty and Responsibility.
