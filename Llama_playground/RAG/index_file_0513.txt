What was the US' relationship with Israel like in the early years after Israel's independence, and how did it change over time? 

At 2023-nov-16, the US was the first country to offer de facto recognition to Israel when it declared independence in 1948, but for the first two decades after independence, Israel's primary foreign ally was France. The US' diplomatic cover for Israel was limited, and its aid was limited to loans to buy food. However, following Israel's victory in the 1967 six-day war, the US increased its weapons sales to Israel and committed to maintaining its "qualitative military edge", leading to decades of strong military and diplomatic alliance between the two countries.
