What is the current situation regarding the potential Israeli invasion of Rafah?

At 2024-apr-12, the situation regarding the potential Israeli invasion of Rafah is unclear. Netanyahu has announced the authorization of the invasion at least four times in the last two months, but senior officials in the Biden administration consider it to be bluster. There are also other reasons behind Netanyahu’s threats, such as negotiating tactics to pressure Hamas to accept Israel’s terms for the release of hostages or to appease the extreme-right members of his ruling coalition. Meanwhile, the situation in Gaza is already completely insupportable, with civilians facing starvation and the basic right to health being “utterly out of reach”.
