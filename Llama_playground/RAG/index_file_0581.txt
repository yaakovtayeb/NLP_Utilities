Why has Egypt not fully opened its Gaza border for fleeing Palestinians?

At 2023-nov-02, egypt is caught in a dilemma about opening the Rafah crossing into Gaza, wanting to help the most seriously injured Palestinians leave but adamantly refusing to contemplate a surge of Palestinian refugees into the Sinai peninsula. Egypt considers the housing of up to 1 million Palestinians in camps in his country a political risk not worth taking. Moreover, the selection process for who can leave is opaque. Egyptâ€™s concern is that the current trickle turns into an avalanche.
