What is the latest update on the conflict in Gaza?
Jordan reported that two of its aid convoys were attacked by Israeli settlers on their way to Gaza, resulting in the dumping of some of their cargo, including food, flour, and other necessities, in the streets. The Hamas-led health ministry has issued updated casualty figures, claiming that at least 34,568 Palestinians have been killed and 77,765 wounded in Israel’s military offensive on Gaza since 7 October. The US secretary of state Antony Blinken has met with Israeli leaders to push for a cease-fire deal between Israel and Hamas to free hostages and bring a pause in the nearly seven months of war. A set of agreements on security and technology-sharing between the US and Saudi Arabia was also drafted, which was intended to be linked to a broader Middle East settlement involving Israel and the Palestinians. However, in the absence of a ceasefire in Gaza, the Saudis are pushing for a more modest plan B, which excludes the Israelis.
