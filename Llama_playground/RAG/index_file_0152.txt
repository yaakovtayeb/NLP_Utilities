What is the Biden administration's stance on Israel's planned offensive on Rafah, and what is their proposed solution to the crisis in Gaza?

At 2024-mar-18, the Biden administration considers the planned offensive on Rafah a mistake and is urging Israel to allow more aid into Gaza to prevent an imminent famine. They have proposed an integrated humanitarian and political plan and have invited a team of military, intelligence, and humanitarian officials from Israel to discuss alternatives to attacking Rafah in Washington. They are also hoping to beat the projected schedule of 45 to 60 days for building a floating dock off the Gaza Strip for delivering aid delivered by sea.
