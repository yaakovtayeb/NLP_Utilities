What is Suella Braverman demanding in relation to pro-Palestine marches and what has been the response from Conservative MPs?

At 2023-nov-12, suella Braverman is demanding "further action" against pro-Palestine marches due to "sick, inflammatory and, in some cases, clearly criminal chants, placards and paraphernalia openly on display" at the main march. Conservative MPs have expressed despair at Rishi Sunak's delay in sacking his rogue home secretary and one senior backbencher predicted “a lot of noise” from angry colleagues when they return to parliament on Monday.
