What is the situation of children in Gaza according to the deputy chief of the UN children's agency? 

At 2024-jan-18, children in Gaza are suffering from “horrific conditions” and the Palestinian territory remains the most dangerous place in the world to be a child, according to the deputy chief of the UN children’s agency. The situation has gone from catastrophe to near collapse, and if the staggering decline in conditions persists, we could see deaths due to indiscriminate conflict compounded by deaths due to disease and hunger.
