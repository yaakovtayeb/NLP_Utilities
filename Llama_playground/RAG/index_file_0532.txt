What was the outcome of the extraordinary summit in Riyadh regarding the Israeli assault on Gaza?

At 2023-nov-12, gulf state leaders fended off an Iranian-led attempt to call for arming the Palestinians and severing all diplomatic ties with Israel at the extraordinary summit in Riyadh. The final OIC communique called for an end to the sale of weapons and ammunition to Israel, and a loosely worded proposal to break the humanitarian siege that did not explicitly mention the Rafah crossing from Egypt into Gaza. It also called on the international criminal court and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons to investigate possible Israeli war crimes, and for more decisive action from the UN security council. It also condemned “the Israeli aggression against the Gaza Strip, the war crimes and the barbaric and inhumane massacres perpetrated by the occupation government”. The lengthy statement made no mention of a ban on oil sales, a tactic used in the 1973 Yom Kippur war, the severance of diplomatic relations with Israel or the arming of the Palestinians.
