What is the current political situation in Egypt ahead of the upcoming election?

At 2023-dec-10, the upcoming election in Egypt is expected to result in a third mandate for President Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, with little prospect of free and fair elections. The posters of Sisi’s face are plastered on every available wall and billboard across the country, and people have turned to making memes of them to share online. Most Egyptians are more concerned with Israel’s assault on Gaza, just over a border in the Sinai that has long remained closed.
