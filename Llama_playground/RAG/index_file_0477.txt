What is the current state of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, and what recent developments have occurred?

At 2023-nov-28, the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas has been extended by two days. Eleven Israeli hostages were released from Gaza in return for dozens of Palestinians held in Israeli jails, and a further release is scheduled to take place. The extension has brought relief, but there are fears of a return to fighting when the deadline expires on Thursday morning. The US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, will visit the Middle East this week to discuss humanitarian assistance, the release of all hostages and the future of Gaza after the war.
