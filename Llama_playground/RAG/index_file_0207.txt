What steps can the Biden administration take to isolate Israeli settlements politically and strengthen the legitimate representatives of the Palestinian people?

At 2024-feb-28, the Biden administration can label goods manufactured in the settlements as coming from the occupied territories, not from Israel, stop funding any binational research from institutions inside the settlements, treat settlers differently from Israeli citizens when they apply for the new US visa waiver program, scrutinize US-based non-profits that raise money for the settlements through existing IRS laws, demand from Israel strong policing of any settler violence and ramifications for violence against Palestinian civilians, condition aid on a percentage of what Israel uses to build any new settlements or housing in settlements, help ease the PA’s incumbent president, Mahmoud Abbas, into a ceremonial position and bring more technical expertise into the PA leadership, host a regional conference – with Israel and the PA as participants – that would talk about a regional future that integrates Israel into the region only if there is a viable Palestinian state, reopen the Palestinian mission that was shuttered by Trump, and differentiate between the state of Israel within the “green line” and the occupied Palestinian territories.
