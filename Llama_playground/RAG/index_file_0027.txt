What was the consequence of the claim that Unrwa was colluding with Hamas and that its employees were involved in the 7 October attack? 

At 2024-may-02, the claim that Unrwa was colluding with Hamas and that its employees were involved in the 7 October attack was a lie that helped lay the groundwork for a devastating, ongoing, man-made famine inside the Gaza Strip. In late January, after a relentless anti-Unrwa campaign by Israel and its proxies in the west which culminated in the unproven accusation that Unrwa employees were involved in the 7 October atrocities, 16 donor countries, including Unrwaâ€™s main financial sponsor, the United States, suspended around $450m funding to the agency.
