What is PalFest and why was it almost cancelled? 

At 2023-oct-30, palFest is the Palestine festival of literature, an annual event in London since 2008 that was co-founded by the Egyptian author Ahdaf Soueif. It was almost cancelled after the Royal Geographical Society cancelled their booking, following security fears in the light of the Israel-Hamas war.
