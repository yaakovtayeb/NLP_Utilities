What is the current status of the potential normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel?

At 2023-sep-21, the potential normalisation deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel is getting closer every day, according to the Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Riyadh is exploring an agreement to normalise relations with Israel in return for a formal defence pact with the US and assistance in developing a civilian nuclear programme. However, Saudi Arabia has so far held out on recognising Israel until the conflict with the Palestinians is resolved.
