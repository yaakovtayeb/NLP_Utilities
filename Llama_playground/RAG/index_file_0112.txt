What were the losses in the six-month war between Gaza and Israel, and what impact did it have on both sides? 

At 2024-apr-05, the war resulted in the deaths of 1,200 Israelis and an estimated 33,000 Palestinians. Many Palestinians were also left maimed and orphaned, and 134 Israelis were held hostage. Hamas lost an estimated 10,000 men and almost all its arsenal of rockets. However, despite the destruction and suffering, Hamas remains the prominent actor in Gaza, and their approval rating among the people of Gaza stands at 70%. Israel, on the other hand, has never been more isolated and has faced widespread criticism from its allies for the killing of aid workers and the restrictions and obstacles that inflict suffering on ordinary Palestinians.
