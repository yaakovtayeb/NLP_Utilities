What is Edelman's trust barometer and how has it been used by authoritarian governments?

At 2023-nov-24, edelman's trust barometer is a survey that measures public trust in governments and institutions. The survey has found that citizens of authoritarian countries tend to trust their governments more than people living in democracies do. However, Edelman has been criticized for not disclosing its financial relationships with some of these same authoritarian governments, which have also been its clients. These governments have exploited Edelman's findings to burnish their reputations and legitimize their holds on power.
