What is the report by the UN human rights expert on Israel's actions in Gaza?

At 2024-mar-25, the UN human rights expert will deliver a report on Tuesday saying that Israel has carried out acts of genocide in Gaza and should be placed under an arms embargo. The report states that there were “reasonable grounds” to believe that Israel was carrying out three of the five acts defined as genocide: killing Palestinians, causing them serious bodily or mental harm, and “deliberately inflicting conditions of life calculated to bring about the physical destruction” of the population in whole or in part. The report also recommends that UN member states immediately implement an arms embargo on Israel.
