What are the feelings and experiences of the Jewish and Palestinian Australian communities in the wake of the recent conflict in the Middle East?

At 2023-oct-14, the Jewish and Palestinian Australian communities are deeply scarred by the recent conflict in the Middle East, with families mourning the loss of loved ones, praying for the safe return of those missing, and fearing the catastrophe of an escalating conflict. The civic space for Palestinians to protest or mourn for their people feels small, feels constricted, and is shrinking. The Jewish community is also suffering, with schoolchildren going to school in plain clothes, rather than their uniforms, because they fear being targeted.
