What is the Israeli military's response to the drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers? 

At 2024-apr-05, the Israeli military has dismissed two officers and reprimanded three others for their roles in the drone strikes in Gaza that killed seven aid workers on a food-delivery mission. The military has admitted that the officers mishandled critical information and violated the army’s rules of engagement. The findings are likely to renew scepticism over the Israeli military’s decision-making.
