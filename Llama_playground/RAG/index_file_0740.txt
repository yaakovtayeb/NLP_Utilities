What is the US's position on the Israel-Palestine conflict and what is the suggested solution to end the bloodshed?

At 2023-oct-10, the US is currently supporting Israel's military campaign in Gaza and has promised to offer all appropriate means of support to Israel. However, some experts suggest that the US can exert its power to stop the bloodshed by pressuring Israel and Hamas to free the Israeli hostages, end the bombing, and end the blockade of Gaza. The only viable alternative to endless bloodshed is to reach a just, long-term resolution to this conflict that enables Palestinians and Israelis alike to live in peace and dignity by addressing the root causes of political violence in Palestine.
