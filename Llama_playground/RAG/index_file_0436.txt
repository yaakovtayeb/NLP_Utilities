What is the current situation in Gaza with the onset of winter and how is it affecting the displaced Palestinians?

At 2023-dec-10, the situation in Gaza with the onset of winter is worsening and affecting the displaced Palestinians. The overcrowded and insanitary conditions are exacerbating communicable diseases, such as jaundice, hepatitis A, and meningitis. There is also a shortage of antibiotics, which is driving deaths from post-operative infections among the wounded. Women are giving birth in tents in unsterile conditions, and those in need of medicine have been forced to go sometimes up to 10 pharmacies in an often fruitless search.
