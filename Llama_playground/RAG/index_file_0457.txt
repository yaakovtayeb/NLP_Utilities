What is the reaction to the news that a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists have been given access to Cop28?
Climate NGOs and activists have expressed outrage at the news that a record number of fossil fuel lobbyists have been given access to Cop28. Climate Action Network highlights that there are more fossil fuel lobbyists than delegates from the 10 most climate-vulnerable countries combined and more than seven times the number of fossil fuel lobbyists than official Indigenous representatives. The Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty calls for a stop to negotiating with fossil fuel lobbyists and for the regulation of fossil fuel companies. The presence of fossil fuel lobbyists at the climate talks is seen as a conflict of interest and a threat to the progress of climate negotiations.
