What is the situation on the Israeli-Lebanese border and why are some Israelis concerned about it?

At 2024-mar-17, hezbollah fighters are just a few kilometers away from the Israeli border, and they have been trading fire with Israeli forces since October 7. As a result, about 80,000 people have been evacuated, and border towns, villages, and kibbutzim are now ghost communities. Many Israelis believe that Hezbollah needs to be forced back from the border to ensure the safety of the evacuated communities.
