What is al-Mawasi and why did Nariman Salman and her family flee to it?

At 2024-mar-26, al-Mawasi is a narrow strip of coastline in Gaza that was designated as a "humanitarian zone" by the Israeli military. Nariman Salman and her family fled to al-Mawasi due to the catastrophic situation in northern Gaza where they were living on rice and beans and grass, and her eldest son was stabbed to death for a bag of flour.
