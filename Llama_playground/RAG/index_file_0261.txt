What is the current situation in Rafah and what are the potential consequences of an Israeli ground offensive in the area?

At 2024-feb-08, the situation in Rafah is dire, with around half of Gaza's population seeking refuge in the city. Israeli troops are set to enter the area despite warnings from the UN secretary general, and a ground offensive could lead to war crimes and devastating civilian casualties. The UN has warned that such an offensive could worsen the already dire humanitarian situation, and there are fears that it could cut off Gaza's lifeline completely. The least grim scenario for Rafah now looks like further mass displacement and a deepening humanitarian disaster.
