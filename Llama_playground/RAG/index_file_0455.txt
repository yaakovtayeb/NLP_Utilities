What is the current situation in Gaza amid the Israeli-Hamas war?

At 2023-dec-05, israeli forces have intensified their offensives in northern and southern Gaza, leading to a rise in civilian deaths. The UN reported some of the heaviest shelling in Gaza, and the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry reported 349 Palestinians killed and 750 injured. The Biden administration imposed a visa ban on Israeli settlers engaged in violence against Palestinian civilians in the occupied West Bank, and Israel's military offensive has claimed more than 16,200 lives in Gaza since 7 October, according to Gaza's health ministry. The resumption of the IDF offensive has significantly reduced the capacity of aid workers to distribute supplies around Gaza, at a time when severe overcrowding in the south, combined with a lack of sanitation, threatens to accelerate the spread of disease.
