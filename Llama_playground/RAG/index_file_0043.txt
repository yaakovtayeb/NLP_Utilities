What is the kafala labour system and how does it affect female domestic workers in the Middle East?
The kafala labour system is a sponsorship system that disregards migrant workers’ rights and depends on exploitation. Female domestic workers, who are generally excluded from labour protection laws by working in private homes, are heavily dependent on their employers. The women interviewed by the Guardian worked seven-day weeks and had passports confiscated by their employers. Many reported being subjected to violence and sexual abuse, and most had to pay recruitment fees to get their jobs. Leaving their workplace is a criminal offense under kafala laws.
