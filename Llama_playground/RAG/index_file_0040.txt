What would be the impact of a serious escalation of tensions in the Middle East on oil prices, inflation, and global commodity prices according to the World Bank?

At 2024-apr-25, the World Bank has warned that a serious escalation of tensions in the Middle East would push the price of oil above $100 a barrel, reverse the recent downward trend in global inflation, and raise global inflation in 2024 by nearly one percentage point. Additionally, an escalation of the conflict in the Middle East could also drive up prices of natural gas, fertilisers, and food.
