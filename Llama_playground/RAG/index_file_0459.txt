What is the US doing to reduce methane emissions and by how much?

At 2023-dec-02, the US has announced a major crackdown on methane emissions as part of a new effort to curb a “super pollutant” that is turbocharging the climate crisis. The new rules are the centrepiece of global announcements to cut methane emissions at Cop28. The US estimates they will cut methane emissions from its vast oil and gas industry by 80% from levels that would be expected without the rule – a total of 58m tonnes by 2038.
