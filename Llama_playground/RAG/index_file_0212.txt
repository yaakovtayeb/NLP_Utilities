What do we know about the draft Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal?

At 2024-feb-27, the draft Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal envisions a 40-day break in fighting during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, which will start around 10 March. Israeli hostages would be released in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and an increase of aid supplies into Gaza, as well as equipment and fuel to start rebuilding. The main terms of the draft deal, as reported by Reuters, are a ceasefire, hostage release, prisoner release, and aid and reconstruction. Despite signs both sides may be open to compromise, officials from Israel, Hamas and Qatar said significant differences remained and a deal was still a long way off.
