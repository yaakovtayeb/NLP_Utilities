What is the judicial overhaul being proposed by Israel’s far-right and ultra-religious government and what are the concerns of its critics?

At 2023-jul-24, the government is proposing a wide-ranging change to the judiciary, including abolishing the court’s power to overrule government decisions and allowing a simple majority of 61 in the 120-seat Knesset to override almost any supreme court rulings. Critics are concerned that the proposals will result in an erosion of democratic norms and the rule of law, and have sparked the biggest protest movement in Israeli history.
