What is President Biden's response to the attack by Hamas on Israeli towns and villages, and how is the US supporting Israel in this conflict?

At 2023-oct-16, president Biden expressed heartfelt support for Israel and pledged "surging" support, including sending aircraft carriers to deter hostile actions against Israel. The US immediately moved to deliver critically needed munitions and military equipment to reinforce Israel's capability and dispatched the aircraft carrier Gerald R Ford, along with a missile cruiser and four missile destroyers, to the region. The US is treating the situation as if Israel were a full member of NATO, seeing the attacks on its close Middle Eastern ally as a declaration of war on the US.
