How are families in Gaza preparing for Ramadan amid the ongoing conflict? 

At 2024-mar-10, families in Gaza are preparing for Ramadan in makeshift camps, such as dilapidated tents, and are struggling to find basic supplies like fresh fruit and vegetables. Many are surviving on flatbread cooked over wood fires or basic gas hobs, and tinned goods trucked in by humanitarian agencies from Egypt. The streets bear the scars of Israeli bombings, and the community is in mourning.
