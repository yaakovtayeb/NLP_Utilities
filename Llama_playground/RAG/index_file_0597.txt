What is the Israeli government's current strategy against Hamas in Gaza? 

At 2023-oct-30, the Israeli government's current strategy against Hamas in Gaza is to focus on substantially degrading its military capabilities, particularly its ability to produce and launch missiles, rockets, and armed drones. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) will seek to encircle and weaken Hamas until the threat it poses to Israeli population centers becomes negligible or manageable. This will be done through a sustained pressure campaign, including raids by Israeli special forces to collect better intelligence on the enemy and target Hamas leadership and command and control centers. The strategy is a more limited approach to taking on Hamas, which could reduce collateral damage and leave hope for diplomacy and the possibility of a prisoner swap.
