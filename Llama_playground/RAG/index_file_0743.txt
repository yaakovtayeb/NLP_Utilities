What are the allegations against Amazon in relation to labor trafficking and exploitation of Nepali workers in Saudi Arabia?

At 2023-oct-10, nepali workers claim they were misled about their employment terms, charged illegal recruiting fees, and subjected to poor working and living conditions, low pay, and abrupt layoffs at Amazon's warehouses in Saudi Arabia. These workers say that they were employed by a Saudi labor supply company, rather than directly by Amazon, and that they were forced to pay large exit fees to return home to Nepal. The allegations suggest that Amazon may be profiting from labor trafficking practices, which include using force, coercion, or fraud to induce workers to provide services.
