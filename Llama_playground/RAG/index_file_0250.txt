What is the impact of the destruction of Palestinian homes on the people and their memories?

At 2024-feb-14, the destruction of Palestinian homes is not just a physical act of violence but also a spiritual one. It is violence against the memory of “whispers, scents, possessions and our children’s laughter”. The deliberate destruction of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian homes has prompted some people to characterise Israel’s actions as “domicide”. This marks the fourth generation of Palestinian homes to be destroyed since the Nakba, the catastrophe inflicted by Israel that shattered Palestinian society in 1948. Despite the continuing domicide, the western world continues to turn a blind eye, refusing to act or acknowledge the suffering of the Palestinian people.
