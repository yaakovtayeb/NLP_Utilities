What is the "axis of resistance" and how does it relate to the current conflict in the Middle East?

At 2024-jan-14, the "axis of resistance" is a network of autonomous militant Islamist groups through which Iran can project power, determine the course of events and deter attack by Israel or the US. Its roots lie in the Iranian Revolution of 1979, which brought to power radical Shia Muslim clerics keen on exporting their brand of extremism across the Islamic world. The current crisis marks the first time the axis has mobilised on multiple fronts, and most experts believe Iran wants to fight the US and Israel without entering into direct conflict.
