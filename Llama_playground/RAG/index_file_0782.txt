What led to the extent of devastation caused by the floods in Derna, Libya?

At 2023-sep-13, the extent of devastation caused by the floods in Derna, Libya was a function of the country's failed politics, including the centralization of power and the lack of infrastructure investment. The two large dams built in the narrow valley above Derna were an accident waiting to happen, especially because poorly constructed housing built close to the river had become increasingly dense and high-rise. Money was set aside for work on the dams, but an audit circulating online shows little of it seems to have been spent. Once the flood waters overwhelmed the first dam they quickly accumulated behind the second, causing it, too, to burst. Nor were instructions given to mount an evacuation as the storm neared.
