What is the current terror threat level in the UK and why is it being kept under close review?

At 2023-dec-15, the current terror threat level in the UK is rated as substantial, the third of five tiers, meaning an attack is considered likely. It is being kept under “very close and regular review” due to concerns that extremist groups could target Jewish institutions in the UK and whether the war in the Middle East could galvanize extremists into taking violent action.
