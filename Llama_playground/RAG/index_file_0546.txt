What is the Camel Meat and Cassette Tapes project and what is its significance?

At 2023-nov-09, the Camel Meat and Cassette Tapes project is an art and research project that celebrates the legacy of letter tapes. It explores the cultural and personal significance of the letter tapes, which were one of the main forms of communication between Somalis in the diaspora and their families back home before mobile phones. The project aims to generate a sense of belonging and to move beyond one-dimensional narratives of violence and trauma, to show the breadth of Somali culture â€“ its humour, joy and creativity.
