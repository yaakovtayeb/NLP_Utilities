What is the current situation in southern Gaza and what are the concerns regarding the largest remaining hospital in the area?

At 2024-jan-19, israeli forces have advanced further into southern Gaza, with airstrikes and close-combat fighting nearing areas crowded with more than a million people who have sought refuge from fighting and destruction across the rest of the territory.
