What are the main obstacles to reaching a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas? 

At 2024-mar-04, the main obstacles to reaching a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas are the demands made by both sides. Hamas is demanding the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, the production of a list of hostages specifying which are alive and which are dead, and a complete Israeli military withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. Israel, on the other hand, is demanding information on which hostages are still alive, the release of vulnerable hostages such as the sick and wounded, elderly people, and women, and the prevention of a threatened Israeli ground attack on the Rafah region. Additionally, the fallout from the deaths of 115 Palestinian people after desperate crowds surrounded aid trucks and Israeli troops opened fire could influence Hamas's stance.
