What is the current situation in Gaza and what is the concern regarding a ground invasion?

At 2023-oct-15, the situation in Gaza is devastating as Israeli jets and artillery continue to pound the area, resulting in the deaths of thousands of Palestinians. With a ground invasion imminent, many Palestinians have fled their homes in response to Israel’s demand that Palestinians in the north move south of the Wadi Gaza riverbed. However, most of Gaza’s hospitals are in the north, prompting the World Health Organization to say the order is a “death sentence” to patients. The concern is that Israel’s call is less about protecting civilian lives and more an attempt to give itself diplomatic cover for Palestinian deaths.
