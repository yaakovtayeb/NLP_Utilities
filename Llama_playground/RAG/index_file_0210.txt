What is the latest casualty figure in Gaza and what is the situation on the ground according to Hamas? 

At 2024-feb-27, the health ministry in Gaza has reported that in the last 24 hours, 96 Palestinians were killed and 172 were injured by Israelâ€™s military actions in the territory. Hamas has said that US President Joe Biden's words about a halt to fighting in Gaza are premature and do not match the situation on the ground, as there are still "big gaps that need to be bridged".
