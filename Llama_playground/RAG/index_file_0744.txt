What are some of the labor conditions that migrant workers at major US and UK brands in the Persian Gulf are facing, according to The Guardian's investigation?

At 2023-oct-10, almost 100 current and former migrant laborers spoke to reporters, and many claimed they were misled into taking poorly paid jobs, subject to extortionate and arbitrary fees, or had their passports confiscated. These practices are broadly considered to be indicators of labor trafficking. The workers were generally employed by franchise holders, other local partners or labor supply firms.
