What prompted the US airstrikes in Syria and what is the US hoping to achieve with them?
 

At 2023-oct-27, the US airstrikes in Syria were prompted by a series of attacks on US military bases in eastern Syria and western Iraq over the last 10 days. The attacks were carried out by rockets and drones, and there were 22 such attacks. More than 20 US service personnel have been injured, though not seriously, and a civilian contractor died of cardiac arrest. The US hopes to protect its soldiers in Syria and Iraq who are there to reinforce the campaign against Islamic State (IS) and also to deter Iran, who does not want to risk a costly all-out confrontation.
