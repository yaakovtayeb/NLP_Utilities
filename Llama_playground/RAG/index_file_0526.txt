What is the UK government's stance on supporting an international criminal court inquiry into potential war crimes committed by Israel?

At 2023-nov-12, the UK government has opposed an ICC investigation into alleged war crimes committed by Israel, insisting that Israel is not party to the statute of Rome and Palestine is not a sovereign state. However, the shadow foreign secretary, David Lammy, is challenging the government and calling for all parties to uphold international law. Labour supports the independence of the international criminal court and recognises its jurisdiction to address the conduct of all parties in Gaza.
