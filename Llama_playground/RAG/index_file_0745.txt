What is the joint investigation by various media partners, including The Guardian US and NBC News, uncovering about labor abuses in the Persian Gulf region?

At 2023-oct-10, the joint investigation is uncovering how nearly 100 migrant workers from Asia have been subjected to repressive labor practices while working at the Persian Gulf locations of four well-known American and British brands: McDonaldâ€™s, Amazon, Chuck E Cheese and the InterContinental Hotels Group. The workers have been interviewed as part of Trafficking Inc, and they say independent employment agents in their home countries coerced them into paying exorbitant recruiting fees, while labor contractors and workplace supervisors in Saudi Arabia and other destination countries subjected them to abuses that included confiscating their passports and limiting their freedom to leave their jobs.
