What is the UK government's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the recent violence in Gaza?

At 2023-oct-18, the UK government, both the Conservative and Labour parties, have been criticized for their unequivocal support for Israel and their failure to condemn the bombing of civilians, hospitals, and ambulances in Gaza. The UK has also licensed at least Â£442m worth of arms to Israel since 2015, while the US provides about $3bn in military assistance each year. Labour leaders have issued feeble statements about how "Israel's defence must be in line with international law", when they know full well that it isn't, and that they helped offer a green light for this criminality.
