What were the aims of Hamas's military assault on Israel and why did they choose to launch it now?

At 2023-oct-08, hamas's military assault on Israel was designed to terrorize and have a wide international audience, rather than to take and hold ground in Israel. The timing of the assault is linked to the wider context in the region, particularly the ongoing US-brokered normalization between Israel and Saudi Arabia. Hamas sees this as an opportunity to impose itself on wider Middle East diplomacy.
