At 2023-dec-31, alaa Abd el-Fattah, a British-Egyptian writer and activist, has been sentenced to five years in detention in Egypt. The British government has failed to act to free him, despite promising to do so, and has provided little information about its efforts to engage with the Egyptian regime to free him. The British Foreign Office has declined to share requested information with Abd el-Fattah's family or to answer FoI requests from the Guardian. The Egyptian government has persistently refused to recognize Abd el-Fattah's British citizenship, despite acknowledging his sister's, who also acquired it in prison.
