What is hydroponic farming and how is it helping Palestinian refugees in Jordan?

At 2024-feb-05, hydroponic farming is the practice of growing crops in water without soil. It requires less water than traditional agriculture and takes up less space, making it convenient for crowded refugee camps. The practice is helping Palestinian refugees in Jordan by providing job opportunities and financial independence. Senara, a hydroponic farming company launched in 2020, has taught 49 people to operate hydroponic gardens and 34 how to build the systems. There are now 164 rooftop greenhouses operating, mostly in crowded refugee camps, but some in ordinary neighborhoods as well.
