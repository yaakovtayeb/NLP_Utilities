What caused the schism in the ties between Russia and Israel? 

At 2023-dec-30, the ties between Russia and Israel have reached their lowest point since the fall of the Soviet Union due to Russia's pro-Palestinian stance in the aftermath of the events of 7 October and the contrasting accounts released by Israel and Russia after the call on 10 December. Netanyahu voiced displeasure with “anti-Israel positions” taken by Moscow’s envoys at the UN, while voicing “robust disapproval” of Russia’s “dangerous” cooperation with its ally Iran.
