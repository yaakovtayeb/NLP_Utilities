What is the current situation in Jenin refugee camp and how is it affecting the popularity of Hamas in the West Bank?

At 2023-dec-16, the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank has been experiencing routine Israeli raids and violence since the 7 October attack by Hamas gunmen from the Gaza Strip that killed 1,139 Israelis. The violence is fueling both armed Palestinian resistance and popular support for groups such as Hamas. A new generation of fighters in Jenin, calling themselves the Jenin Brigades, is only loosely affiliated with the traditional Palestinian factions such as Fatah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Hamas, in particular, is riding a wave of newfound popularity in the West Bank, with support for Hamas having risen in Gaza and more than tripled in the West Bank. According to a poll by the Palestinian Centre for Policy and Survey Research, 85% of West Bank respondents - or 72% of Palestinian respondents overall - voiced satisfaction with the role of Hamas in the war.
