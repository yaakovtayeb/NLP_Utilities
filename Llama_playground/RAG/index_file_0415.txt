What is the main source of fuel for cooking and heating in Gaza and what are the consequences of this? 

At 2023-dec-16, the main source of fuel for cooking and heating in Gaza is firewood, which is becoming increasingly scarce. This has led to people burning whatever they can find, including waste and even their own trees, causing health concerns due to the smoke released. The use of "dirty fuel" has also led to a significant rise in the number of cases of respiratory illness. The lack of fuel, clean water, and food shortages have combined to increase hunger levels in Gaza.
