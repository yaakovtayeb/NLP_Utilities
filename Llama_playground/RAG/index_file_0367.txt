What is the significance of the killing of Saleh al-Arouri in Beirut and how does it affect the ongoing conflict between Israel and Hezbollah?

At 2024-jan-05, saleh al-Arouri was a high-value target and his killing is a huge blow to Hamas given his longstanding role as a negotiator, including his involvement in the current prisoner exchange talks with Israel and in ongoing efforts for cooperation between Hamas and the rival Fatah movement. It also marks a significant escalation as it represents Israelâ€™s deepest incursion into Lebanese territory since 8 October and its most significant attack since July 2006. Hezbollah held Israel directly accountable for the killing and is likely to respond with a carefully measured retaliation that simultaneously signifies an escalation in terms of scope and intensity but falls short of all-out war.
