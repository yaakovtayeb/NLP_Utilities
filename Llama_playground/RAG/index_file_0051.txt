What is the Noor campaign in Iran and what are its consequences?

At 2024-apr-24, the Noor campaign is a crackdown on "violations" of Iran's hijab rules, which require all women to cover their heads in public. The campaign has resulted in women being violently dragged from the streets and detained by security services, with reports of beatings and assault. Human rights groups have condemned the enforcement of the hijab rules.
