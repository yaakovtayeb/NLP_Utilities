What is the current situation of UK citizens trapped in Gaza? 

At 2023-nov-01, the UK Foreign Office said that the first UK nationals had made it through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt after the border was being opened for “controlled and time-limited periods to allow specific groups of foreign nationals and the seriously wounded to leave”. However, the relatives of some of the 200 British or dual nationals trapped in the Palestinian territory have described scenes of chaos and desperation at the border.
