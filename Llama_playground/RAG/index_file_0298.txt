What is the current situation in the Middle East and what are the potential consequences of the recent militia attack on a US base in Jordan?

At 2024-jan-29, the situation in the Middle East is tense due to the escalating violence between pro-Palestinian, Iran-backed militias and Israel's illegal bombardment of Gaza. The recent militia attack on a US base in Jordan, which President Joe Biden has blamed on Iran, may lead to a direct conflict between the US and Iran with devastating consequences. The scale and reach of the response that Biden has vowed to deliver at any moment will depend on whether the Americans conclude the militants simply got lucky or whether they intentionally escalated the situation.
