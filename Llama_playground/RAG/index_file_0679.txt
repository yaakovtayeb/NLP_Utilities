What is the Project Rozana International's proposal to help Palestinians in Gaza? 

At 2023-oct-19, project Rozana International has proposed to build a triage hospital in partnership with the Red Crescent hospital in Gaza and upgrade its 20 ambulances. The charity believes that the proposed triage hospital could allow doctors to determine if a patient could be treated in Gaza or if they need to be transferred to a hospital elsewhere. They also want to expand their current bus fleet to help get critically ill Gazan residents to hospitals in East Jerusalem.
