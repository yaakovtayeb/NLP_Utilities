What is the current state of Israelis in the face of uncertainty and fear due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza?

At 2023-oct-11, israelis are suspended between fear, grief and grim preparation for more losses, as details of massacres of families in their homes emerge from southern areas, and the country prepares for a major operation against Hamas in Gaza. Normal life has been put on hold. Schools have been closed on a rolling basis, so parents are juggling full-time parenting with working from home, while trying to protect their children from both actual attacks and the corrosive trauma of fear.
