What is the situation of unaccompanied child migrants in Tunisia?

At 2024-mar-11, unaccompanied child migrants in Tunisia are facing arbitrary detention, trafficking, sexual violence and labour exploitation while they are travelling. In 2022, Adam and his younger brother, who were separated from their father, are living on their own and begging for food in the town of Al Amra in Tunisia. Almost 1,500 unaccompanied children approached the offices of the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to seek support and asylum last year. Between January and August 2023, 12% of arrivals by sea to Italy were unaccompanied children.
