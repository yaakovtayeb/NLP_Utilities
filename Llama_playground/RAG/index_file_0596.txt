What is the impact of Israeli restrictions on Palestinian communication infrastructure?

At 2023-oct-30, israeli restrictions on Palestinian cellular providers upgrading their networks has meant that for years Palestinians have had to rely on much slower connections than those in Israel. Palestinians in the West Bank are only able to use 3G mobile services, while those in Gaza only get 2G, which is considerably slower and often more vulnerable to security attacks due to weaker encryption. Israel is upgrading from 4G to 5G. According to a report by 7amleh, the Arab Center for the Advancement of Social Media, since the occupation of the Palestinian territories in 1967, Israel has taken complete control of ICT infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza, which has prevented Palestinians from being able to independently run their own services.
