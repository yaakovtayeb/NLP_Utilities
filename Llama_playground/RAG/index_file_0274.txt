What is the controversy surrounding CNN's coverage of the war in Gaza?

At 2024-feb-04, cNN is facing backlash from its own staff for editorial policies that have resulted in biased coverage of the war in Gaza, with a regurgitation of Israeli propaganda and the censoring of Palestinian perspectives. Journalists say that broadcasts have been skewed by management edicts and a story-approval process that has resulted in highly partial coverage of the Hamas massacre on 7 October and Israelâ€™s retaliatory attack on Gaza. There are tight restrictions on quoting Hamas and reporting other Palestinian perspectives while Israel government statements are taken at face value.
