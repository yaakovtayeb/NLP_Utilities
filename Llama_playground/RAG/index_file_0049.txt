What is the decision made by the German government regarding cooperation with UNRWA in Gaza and why was it made?

At 2024-apr-24, the German government plans to resume cooperation with the UN agency for Palestinians (UNRWA) in Gaza, as Israel has yet to provide evidence to support its accusations against the agency. The decision follows an investigation by Catherine Colonna, which concluded that Israel had not backed up its allegations. The German ministries urged UNRWA to implement the reportâ€™s recommendations, and as a result, the German government will continue its cooperation with UNRWA in Gaza, as other countries have already done.
