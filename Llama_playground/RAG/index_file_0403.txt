What is the current state of Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza? 

At 2023-dec-21, israel is struggling to make substantial progress in the war against Hamas, with indications of difficulties such as the loss of senior IDF soldiers, a high number of disabled soldiers, and significant casualties. The IDF is still following the Dahiya doctrine of massive force, but criticism is coming from unexpected quarters, including the former UK defense minister and even the Biden administration. The IDF commanders are under pressure to succeed, and their aim is to damage Hamas as much as they can, as quickly as they can, whatever the cost to Palestinians. Netanyahu's dependence on an extremist minority of religious fundamentalists and trenchant Zionists in his government is doing more and more harm to Israel's long-term security.
