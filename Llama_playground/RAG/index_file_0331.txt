What is the current situation in Gaza and what is being done to alleviate the food insecurity and famine risks?

At 2024-jan-19, the UN has warned that Gaza's 2.2 million people are highly food insecure and at risk of famine. The US claims to be working relentlessly to get humanitarian aid into Gaza, but Israel's inspections have slowed the aid entering the territory, which is receiving just a tiny fraction of what experts say is needed. The US is focused on trying to increase the volume and speed with which the aid trucks are getting in, but it is unclear whether a large influx of humanitarian aid could even be distributed effectively in the absence of a ceasefire.
