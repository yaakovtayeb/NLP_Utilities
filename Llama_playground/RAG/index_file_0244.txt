What is the situation in Rafah and what is the threat to the refugees there?

At 2024-feb-15, the UN’s humanitarian chief warned about the consequences of an Israeli ground assault on Rafah, Gaza’s southernmost city, and said Palestinian civilians trapped there are “staring death in the face”. Israel intensified its aerial attack on Rafah, and hundreds of thousands of refugees have fled to the area. Israel is yet to set out a plan to keep them safe if it proceeds with a ground operation.
