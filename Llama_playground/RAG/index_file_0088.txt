What is the latest update on the threat of an Iranian attack on Israel?

At 2024-apr-12, the White House national security spokesperson, John Kirby, has stated that the prospect of an Iranian attack on Israel remains a viable threat. The US and Israel are in constant communication to ensure that Israel can defend itself against such attacks. The head of US Central Command, Gen Erik Kurilla, is in Israel talking with Israeli defence officials about how Israel can be best prepared, and it is likely Kurilla is there to influence and moderate any Israeli response. The Biden administration is very concerned about the possibility of out-of-control escalation.
