What is the current situation in Gaza and what actions are being taken to address it?

At 2024-apr-18, the situation in Gaza is dire, with almost 34,000 Palestinians already killed and many more at risk of dying without an immediate ceasefire and massive increase in aid. The US has put pressure on Israel to open more crossing points for humanitarian goods and increase supplies of food and medicine, but progress has been slow and inconsistent. There are concerns that an assault on Rafah could lead to a disaster for those sheltering there and for the broader distribution of aid arriving via its crossing to Egypt. A ceasefire and the release of hostages, along with the promised surge in aid, could help defuse regional tensions and find a path out of the dangers.
