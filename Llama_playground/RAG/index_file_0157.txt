What is the current food supply situation in Gaza, and what did the UN-backed report say about it?

At 2024-mar-18, the current food supply situation in Gaza is catastrophic, with 1.1 million people facing famine according to a report by the UN-backed Integrated Food Security Phase Classification. The report warned of the risk of famine by the end of May 2024 if an immediate cessation of hostilities and sustained access for the provision of essential supplies and services to the population did not take place. Since then, the conditions necessary to prevent famine have not been met and the latest evidence confirms that famine is imminent in the northern governorates and projected to occur anytime between mid-March and May 2024.
