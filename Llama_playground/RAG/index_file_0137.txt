What is the situation of Palestinian immigrants in Australia who arrived on visitor visas after fleeing Israel’s bombardment of Gaza?

At 2024-mar-26, palestinian immigrants who arrived in Australia on visitor visas after fleeing Israel’s bombardment of Gaza are facing an uncertain future as they are unable to work and rely on community groups and charities for housing, food, and clothes. They are not entitled to support services or quick pathways off visitor visas, and community organizations say they are stretched. Human rights experts are calling on the government to introduce a visa pathway for Palestinians fleeing Gaza, just as Australia has for those escaping other conflicts.
