What is the I'm My Voice project and what is its purpose?

At 2024-apr-12, the I'm My Voice project is a cultural organization founded by Russol Al Nasser that establishes children's choirs in different cities across Jordan to preserve oral heritage. Its purpose is to use arts and culture to create a connection with the environment and to preserve pieces of Jordan's heritage that are being lost due to rural-to-urban migration and the diminishing role of agriculture.
