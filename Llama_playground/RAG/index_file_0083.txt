What was the nature of Iran's attack on Israel that took place earlier this month and what could be the consequences of this attack?
Iran attacked Israel directly from its own territory for the first time using 300 drones and long-range missiles. Israel's air defences responded with the support of American, British, French and Jordanian forces and successfully intercepted most of the drones and missiles. The direct nature of the attack may still compel a strong Israeli response, possibly triggering a new and dangerous cycle of escalation.
