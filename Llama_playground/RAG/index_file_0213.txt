What is the situation of hunger and malnutrition in Gaza, and what is the UN's opinion on Israel's actions? 

At 2024-feb-27, according to the UN's leading expert on the right to food, Israel is intentionally starving Palestinians, resulting in widespread hunger and severe malnutrition in Gaza, where about 2.2 million Palestinians are facing severe shortages. The UN expert considers this to be a war crime and a situation of genocide, and holds the state of Israel accountable for intentionally depriving people of food. Reports have emerged of parents feeding their children animal feed in hope of keeping them alive. Nutrition screenings at health centers and shelters in January found almost 16% of children under the age of two were acutely malnourished or wasting in northern Gaza, where 300,000 people are trapped with virtually no food aid being allowed in by Israel.
