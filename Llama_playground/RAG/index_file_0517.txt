What challenges are Palestinian Americans facing at work while mourning the death toll in Gaza?

At 2023-nov-16, palestinian Americans who are attempting to do their jobs while mourning the death toll in Gaza are facing challenges at work. They fear being accused of antisemitism or being conflated with Hamas at work, where their livelihoods are on the line. Some are bothered by their employers’ and colleagues’ reactions (or lack thereof) to the war. They feel like their ethnic identity itself is a minefield, because, as one person described it, “the world denies our existence”.
