What are the challenges faced by pregnant women in Gaza during the Israeli attacks and blockade?

At 2023-dec-29, pregnant women in Gaza are facing challenges as hospitals are emptying of supplies, raided by the Israeli military, and already filled far beyond capacity with victims of the war. The number of functioning hospitals has dropped from 36 to eight, and doctors across Gaza say they are overwhelmed by victims of airstrikes and fighting. This has forced hundreds of women to go through childbirth alone, at home, without medical support or pain relief. The UN has estimated that more than 50,000 women in Gaza were pregnant in October, with over 100 expected to give birth every day amid shortages of basic necessities including food and water, and little access to healthcare.
