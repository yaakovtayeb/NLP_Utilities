What is the danger of viewing the Israel-Palestine conflict as a binary contest? 

At 2023-oct-27, the danger of viewing the Israel-Palestine conflict as a binary contest is that it leads to a need to see one side as all good and the other as all evil. This can lead to strange and dark places and can have a concrete effect on the conflict itself and on those hurt by it. It squeezes the Israel-Palestine conflict into a “decolonisation” frame it doesn’t quite fit, with all Israelis – not just those in the occupied West Bank – defined as the footsoldiers of “settler colonialism”.
