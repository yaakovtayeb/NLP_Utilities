What happened at the UN security council vote regarding Gaza ceasefire and how did the US respond?

At 2024-mar-25, the UN security council passed a resolution demanding an immediate ceasefire in Gaza, and the US did not use its veto to block it, which marks another moment in the painful US diplomatic distancing from its chief ally in the Middle East. The US acknowledged that its effort to grab the UN Gaza agenda had failed, and instead acknowledged the wider mood at the UN, but it claimed that the US abstention does not represent a change in policy.
