Why was the Turkish Super Cup final postponed between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce in Saudi Arabia?

At 2023-dec-29, the Turkish Super Cup final between Galatasaray and Fenerbahce scheduled to be played in Saudi Arabia’s capital, Riyadh, on Friday was postponed over what the clubs have described as “some problems” in the event’s organisation. The wish of the two teams to wear T-shirts featuring the founder of modern Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, during the warm-up before the evening kick-off was at the heart of those issues.
