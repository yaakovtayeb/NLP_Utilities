What was the result of the Knesset vote regarding the creation of a Palestinian state?

At 2024-feb-21, the Knesset voted to support Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's opposition to the "unilateral" creation of a Palestinian state, with 99 out of 120 lawmakers voting in favor. The Israeli position is that any permanent accord with the Palestinians must be reached through direct negotiations between the sides, and not by international dictates. Critics argue that this effectively gives Israel a unilateral veto on the creation of a Palestinian state and is one of the reasons little progress has been made towards a two-state solution since the Oslo Accords were signed 30 years ago.
