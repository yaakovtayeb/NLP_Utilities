What is the Australian government's stance on the conflict in Gaza and how are they balancing political pressures? 

At 2024-jan-20, the Australian government is finding it difficult to please two constituencies with vastly different expectations regarding the conflict in Gaza. Dozens of Labor party branches have passed motions urging the government to call for a full ceasefire, while the Coalition is seeking to make the case that the Labor partyâ€™s internal politics are preventing the government from offering full-throated support for Israel. The government has appeared flat-footed at times and is facing pressure to be definitive if the ICJ issues preliminary orders in coming weeks to suspend the Israeli military offensive or allow more humanitarian access. The government's oft-stated support for a two-state solution is more of a slogan than an achievable reality, at least in the current environment.
