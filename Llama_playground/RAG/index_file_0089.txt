What did Argentina's highest criminal court rule regarding the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires?

At 2024-apr-12, argentina's highest criminal court ruled that Iran was responsible for the 1994 AMIA bombing in Buenos Aires, which killed 85 people, wounded 300, and devastated Latin America's biggest Jewish community. The court declared it a "crime against humanity" and blamed the Shia militant organization Hezbollah for carrying out the attack in response to Argentina reneging on a nuclear cooperation deal with Tehran. The ruling paves the way for victims to seek justice and allows the victims' relatives to bring lawsuits against the Islamic Republic.
