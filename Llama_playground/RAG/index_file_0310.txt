What prompted the scathing criticism from Baghdad towards the US and what was the US response?

At 2024-jan-24, the US strikes against militias in Iraq prompted scathing criticism from Baghdad, accusing Washington of contributing to a "reckless escalation" of regional violence. The US defense secretary, Lloyd Austin, said that the attacks on Kataâ€™ib Hezbollah and other Iran-linked groups were "necessary and proportionate" in response to its own forces coming under attack at an Iraqi airbase at the weekend.
