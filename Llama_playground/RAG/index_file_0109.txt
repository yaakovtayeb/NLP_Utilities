What is the state of the Middle East after the six-month war in Gaza? 

At 2024-apr-06, the Middle East is currently in a state of nonpolarity, with no dominant player, value system or functioning institutions. The great powers compete, coexist or confront one another across the region but none, least of all at the UN, is able to impose its version of order any longer. The war has sparked a crisis in the international system, with many feeling that the lack of reform of global governance institutions, including and primarily the UN security council, is the root cause.
