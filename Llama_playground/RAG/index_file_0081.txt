What was the response of global powers to Iran's missile and drone attack on Israel?

At 2024-apr-15, global powers called for restraint to avoid further escalation after Iran’s unprecedented missile and drone attack on Israel. The United Nations chief, António Guterres, told an emergency meeting of the UN security council on Sunday that the Middle East was “on the brink” and could not afford more war. President Joe Biden warned Israel the US would not take part in a counteroffensive against Iran after Sunday’s attack involving about 300 missiles and drones, almost all of which were intercepted. The UK’s foreign secretary, David Cameron, has urged Israel to act with its head as well as its heart and not escalate the conflict by mounting a revenge raid on Iran.
