What is the current situation in the villages affected by the earthquake in Morocco and who is providing aid?

At 2023-sep-12, the villages affected by the earthquake in Morocco are in need of aid, and ordinary Moroccans are driving their own aid to the mountains amid frustration with the government's efforts. The road partly opened since the weekend as far as the devastated community of Talat N’Yaaqoub about 12 miles (20km) from where the earthquake struck, it has also become the route of choice for thousands of ordinary Moroccans driving their own aid to the mountains amid mounting frustration with the government’s efforts. Ambulances in convoys from Moroccan provinces jostled for space with search and rescue teams and crocodiles of army vehicles carrying generators and earthmovers on low loaders.
