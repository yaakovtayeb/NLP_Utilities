What was the controversy surrounding the course 'Apartheid in Israel-Palestine' at Bard College and who objected to it?

At 2023-nov-08, the Israeli consul for public diplomacy in New York, pro-Israel groups, and at least one major donor objected to the course 'Apartheid in Israel-Palestine' at Bard College, which was designed and taught by Nathan Thrall. They argued that the course breached the controversial International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) definition of antisemitism and that it was inappropriate. However, Bard College defended the course and stood up for academic freedom.
