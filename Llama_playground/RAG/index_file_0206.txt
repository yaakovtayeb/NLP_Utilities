What is the situation with the Rubymar cargo ship and the potential environmental disaster in the Red Sea?

At 2024-feb-28, the Rubymar, a Belize-flagged but British-owned bulk carrier, has been drifting in the Red Sea after it was struck by two missiles. It is leaking an 18-mile oil spill and carrying 41,000 tonnes of volatile fertiliser. The ship is feared to be in danger of sinking, and the internationally recognised government of Yemen warned of an imminent marine environmental disaster if the ship is not quickly rescued.
