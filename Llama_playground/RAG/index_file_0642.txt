What is happening to the children in Gaza during the conflict?

At 2023-oct-23, at least 1,750 children have been killed and thousands more have been injured or traumatized. One child in Gaza was being killed every 15 minutes, and a daily death toll of 200 children and infants was estimated. About 40% of the more than 4,600 Palestinians killed since Israeli forces began their bombardment are children, and at least 3,250 children have been injured. Gaza’s children are suffering “record levels of psychological trauma and terror,” with more than half contemplating suicide and three out of five self-harming.
