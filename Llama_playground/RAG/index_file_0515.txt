What is the history of the Israel-Palestine conflict?

At 2023-nov-09, the conflict has its roots in the late 19th-century Jewish migration to the Ottoman Empire, the Balfour declaration by the British government in 1917, the United Nationsâ€™ vote in 1947 to partition land in the British mandate of Palestine into two states, and the ensuing conflicts with Arab communities there. The conflict escalated until the armies of Egypt, Iraq, Transjordan and Syria invaded after Israel declared independence in May 1948. About 700,000 Palestinians were expelled or fled and were never allowed to return. The PLO was founded in 1964 to pursue armed struggle and establish an Arab state in place of Israel. In 1967, Israel launched a pre-emptive defensive war against Jordan, Egypt and Syria, as they appeared to be preparing to invade. The attack caught Arab governments by surprise and saw Israel achieve rapid victories including seizing the Sinai peninsula and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the Golan Heights from Syria, and the West Bank and East Jerusalem from Jordan.
