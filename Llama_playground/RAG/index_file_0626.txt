What is the situation in Gaza's hospitals according to the Red Cross mission? 

At 2023-oct-25, the Red Cross mission to assess the state of Gazaâ€™s hospitals has described scenes of chaos and exhaustion in the face of a total blockade, a critical fuel shortage, and relentless Israeli bombing. Both hospitals are rapidly running out of fuel and medical supplies. There are hospital workers who have been personally impacted by the conflict and working under the toughest and most unimaginable of conditions in scenes of utter chaos. As well as being packed with patients with severe injuries from bombings, the hospitals are functioning as shelters for thousands of people displaced from their homes.
