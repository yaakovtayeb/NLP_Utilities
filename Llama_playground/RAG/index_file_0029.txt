What is the current state of aid delivery in Gaza and what did US Secretary of State Antony Blinken say about it?

At 2024-may-01, the number of lorries entering Gaza after being vetted by Israel has increased significantly, but these still deliver only a fraction of what is needed. Antony Blinken called on Israel to “accelerate and sustain improvements” seen during recent days in the amount of humanitarian assistance reaching the territory. He highlighted some of the improvements in aid delivery in recent days, including the opening of the port of Ashdod to other kinds of humanitarian aid, the passing of a convoy of aid trucks from Jordan through the Erez crossing, and the upcoming operation of a sea corridor involving a US-made floating dock and pier to deliver ship-borne humanitarian aid.
