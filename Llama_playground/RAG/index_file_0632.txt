What is Israel's intended outcome of the current war with Hamas in Gaza, and why is it likely to fail?

At 2023-oct-25, israel's intended outcome of the current war with Hamas in Gaza is the termination of Hamas, which they plan to achieve through a three-phase operation involving intense air bombardment, ground operations, and the creation of a buffer zone around Gaza. However, previous experience suggests that despite being the far superior military force, they will fail. This is because the war will result in tens of thousands more very angry young Palestinians set to join the organization or a similar successor, and an intense destruction of Gaza could end up displacing the locus of conflict to the West Bank rather than actually ending it.
