What is the current situation in Gaza and what action does Bernie Sanders suggest should be taken to address the humanitarian crisis?

At 2023-nov-01, the situation in Gaza is dire, with hundreds of thousands of innocent people facing catastrophe due to bombings and displacement. Bernie Sanders suggests that the US Congress and international community demand a humanitarian pause to allow sufficient supplies to reach Gaza and save innocent lives. He also believes that a political strategy is necessary for a long-term solution, including a commitment to broader peace talks and a two-state solution, and an abandonment of Israeli efforts to annex the West Bank.
