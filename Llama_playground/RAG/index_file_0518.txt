What is the content of the leaflets that Israel has dropped into southern Gaza and what are the fears that have been raised?

At 2023-nov-16, the leaflets that Israel dropped into southern Gaza told Palestinian civilians to leave four towns on the eastern edge of Khan Younis, warning that anyone in the vicinity of militants or their positions was “putting his life in danger”. This has raised fears that its war against Hamas could spread to areas it previously said were safe.
