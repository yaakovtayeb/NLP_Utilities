What is the uncommitted movement and how did it start in Michigan?

At 2024-mar-17, the uncommitted movement is a strategy used by the burgeoning anti-war movement to get President Biden’s attention by telling Democratic voters to cast ballots for “uncommitted” as a protest against the war in Gaza and to demand a ceasefire. The movement started in Michigan in 2021, inspired by a similar move in Michigan in 2008 when then-candidate Barack Obama was not on the ballot, so his supporters voted “uncommitted” to reject Hillary Clinton’s campaign there.
