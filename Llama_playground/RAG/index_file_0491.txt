What are the difficulties in extending the temporary ceasefire in Gaza?

At 2023-nov-24, the difficulties in extending the temporary ceasefire in Gaza include persuading the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, that he is not being lured into a trap that will extend Hamas’s rule in Gaza and convincing both sides in the war to agree to an extension. Hamas would lose leverage over Israel if all the hostages were released, and Netanyahu risks being drawn into a ceasefire that leaves Hamas’s military structures intact, which runs counter to his vow that this battle is not a repetition of the four previous conflicts with Hamas in Gaza that left it in power.
