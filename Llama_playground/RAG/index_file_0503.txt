What is the current status of the truce negotiations between Hamas and Israel?

At 2023-nov-20, hamas officials are "close to reaching a truce agreement" with Israel and the group has delivered its response to Qatari mediators. The proposed deal includes a five-day truce, comprised of a ceasefire on the ground and limits to Israeli air operations over southern Gaza. In return, between 50 and 100 prisoners held by Hamas and Islamic Jihad would be released. They would include Israeli civilians and captives of other nationalities, but no military personnel. Under the proposed deal, some 300 Palestinians would be released from Israeli jails, among them women and children.
