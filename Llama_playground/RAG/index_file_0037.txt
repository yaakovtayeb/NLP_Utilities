What is the current situation regarding the Israeli and dual-national hostages held in Gaza by Hamas?

At 2024-apr-25, the leaders of 18 countries including the US and the UK have called on Hamas to free Israeli and dual-national hostages held in Gaza. Hamas and other militant groups took 250 people hostage on 7 October as they overran towns and kibbutzim next to Gaza, killing an estimated 1,136 people. After intensive negotiations mediated by Qatar and Egypt, 105 were released as part of a hostage deal last November in exchange for a pause in fighting. The families of Israeli hostages held in Gaza have put renewed pressure on Netanyahu to restart negotiations for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of their loved ones. Hamas recently released a hostage video of an Israeli-American citizen, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, which has led to protests and clashes outside Netanyahu's Jerusalem home.
