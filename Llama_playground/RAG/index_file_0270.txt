What is the impact of the Gaza war on women and babies in terms of healthcare and displacement?

At 2024-feb-05, the conflict in Gaza has had a disproportionate impact on women and children, with healthcare infrastructure being destroyed and pregnant women facing high-risk pregnancies. Displaced mothers struggle to access sufficient food and clean water to produce milk for their babies, and when formula is available, finding clean water to boil and mix with it is a daily challenge. The lack of period products has forced women to use parts of tent fabric, clothes, and cutoff pieces of towels, increasing the risk of infection and toxic shock.
