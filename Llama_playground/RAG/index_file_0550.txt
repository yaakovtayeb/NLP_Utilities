What is happening in the Palestinian town of Huwara?

At 2023-nov-09, the town is split in two by the Israeli military, with only Jewish settlers allowed to use the main road and Palestinian residents forced to take hours-long detours to cross the town. This has been enforced since October 7th, following the massacre of 1,400 people by Hamas, and is one of the most extreme responses by the IDF in the occupied West Bank. The closure of Huwara has had profound consequences on the daily lives of its residents, who are unable to run their businesses or visit family members on the opposite side of the town.
