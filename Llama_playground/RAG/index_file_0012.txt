What is the significance of the Israeli military operation in Rafah?
The Israeli military operation in Rafah is significant because it seized control of the Palestinian side of the Rafah border crossing, which was the key remaining land route to get desperately needed aid into Gaza, where millions of people are suffering an escalating humanitarian crisis. The Israeli military said it had taken “operational control” of the border with Egypt in a “precise and limited operation”, but gave notice that it will soon be followed by an “extreme force” ground offensive that the UN warns could lead to the “slaughter of civilians”.
