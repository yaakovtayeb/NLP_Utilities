What is the current situation between Israel and Iran in the Middle East? 

At 2024-apr-19, israel and Iran have engaged in a tit-for-tat exchange of fire aimed at each other’s sovereign terrain, with Iran crossing what had previously been a red line and aiming a barrage of missiles and drones directly at Israeli territory for the first time, and Israel responding with a series of drone strikes on targets inside Iran, including Isfahan, site of an airbase and the country’s burgeoning nuclear programme. Both sides are trying to avoid a major escalation into all-out war, but the risk of escalation is real.
