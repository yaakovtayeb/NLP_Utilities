What is the current state of the conflict in the Middle East, and what are the potential consequences of continued escalation?

At 2024-jan-29, the conflict in the Middle East is escalating, with the US and its allies conducting airstrikes on Yemen and blaming Iran for attacks on US soldiers in Jordan. Both sides claim they do not want war, but tit-for-tat retaliation could quickly spiral out of control. Meanwhile, funding has been withdrawn from the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees, causing concern for the 2 million people it supports. The UN warns that famine is now "imminent" and "inevitable".
