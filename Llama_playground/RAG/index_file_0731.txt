What is the current situation of the families of the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza?

At 2023-oct-11, the families of the hostages are enduring an agonising wait for news of their loved ones as retaliatory Israeli missile strikes continue to pound the enclave. The fate of the hostages, both Israeli and foreign, remains unclear. Their relatives’ fears are being exacerbated by Hamas’s threats to kill one hostage for each new Israeli airstrike on civilian targets without warning, and by the prospect of a possible ground offensive.
