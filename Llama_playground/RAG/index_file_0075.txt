What is the IRGC, and why is the UK facing pressure to proscribe it as a terrorist group?

At 2024-apr-15, the IRGC is Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which was established after Iran’s 1979 revolution to defend the country’s Islamic system and to act as a counterweight to the army. The UK is facing cross-party pressure to proscribe the IRGC as a terrorist group after Tehran’s assault on Israel over the weekend. The shadow defence secretary, John Healey, and the former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused the government of being slow to act in the face of evidence of a growing risk to UK interests.
