What is the author's opinion on the possibility of restarting the peace process in the Middle East after the recent conflict between Israel and Hamas?

At 2023-nov-02, the author believes that it is possible for a comprehensive solution to be formulated, predicated on the satisfaction of the minimum core needs and aspirations of the Palestinian and Israeli peoples and the allaying of their maximum fears. The conflict can still be resolved, but if the chance is not seized quickly and robustly, future seismic explosions - foreseen or unforeseen - lay in wait.
