What is the current political situation in Israel and what is the potential outcome of the proposed Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal with Hamas?

At 2024-feb-04, the current political situation in Israel is characterized by a deep national schism, with an existential struggle being waged over the country’s democratic character, future leadership, relationships with the Palestinians and the Arab states, and international standing. The potential outcome of the proposed Gaza ceasefire and hostage-release deal with Hamas is the collapse of Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s fractious, rightwing ruling coalition, as far-right politicians are vowing to collapse the government rather than condone what they claim would be a victory for terrorism.
