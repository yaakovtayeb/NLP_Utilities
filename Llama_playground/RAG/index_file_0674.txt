What was the purpose of Joe Biden's visit to the Middle East and what challenges did he face?

At 2023-oct-18, joe Biden's visit to the Middle East was intended to show solidarity after the recent violence and to urge a strategically informed response by Israel to avoid overreaction. However, Arab leaders pulled out of their scheduled meeting with Biden in Amman, making it difficult for him to use face-to-face US presidential influence to discourage escalation. The collapse of Biden's Amman meeting is a serious blow to this strategy, and the widespread regional dismissal of Israel's denial of responsibility for the hospital attack is also a challenge.
