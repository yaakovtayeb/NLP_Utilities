What is the current situation in Zamzam camp in Sudan's Darfur region?

At 2024-feb-21, the situation in Zamzam camp is dire, with a child dying every two hours due to hunger and disease. The camp has no clean drinking water, little access to medical treatment, and almost 25% of children are severely malnourished. Dengue fever and malaria are also spreading, and militiamen roam the area. The camp's population has swelled with new arrivals fleeing fighting farther south, and it has been completely left on its own.
