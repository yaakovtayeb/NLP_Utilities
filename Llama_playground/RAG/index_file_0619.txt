What are Israel's war aims in Gaza and how do they plan to achieve them?

At 2023-oct-27, israel's war aims are to destroy Hamas's military and governing abilities. They plan to achieve this through a ground offensive, which will involve holding ground in the north of Gaza long enough to destroy Hamas's heavy weaponry and tunnel network, and mounting "search and destroy" attacks aimed at Hamas members, civilian and military. The ultimate political aims of the war, however, remain unclear.
