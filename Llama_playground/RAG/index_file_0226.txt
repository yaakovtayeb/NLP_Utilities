What is the current situation in Gaza, according to the author's diary entry?

At 2024-feb-21, the author describes a place full of old people waiting for a miracle to happen or for death to select them. The children have lost their innocence due to trauma and a lack of a normal life. The cost of living has soared due to Israeli attacks, and basic necessities like nappies and sugar have become scarce and expensive. People are setting up tents on pavements, and families are displaced. Despite the chaos, the grandmother of the author's host family continues to work tirelessly and never complains.
