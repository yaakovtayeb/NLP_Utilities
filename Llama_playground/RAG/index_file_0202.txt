What is the impact of Israel's visa freeze on international staff of humanitarian organisations working in occupied Palestinian territories?

At 2024-feb-29, the visa freeze has stopped the issuance of visas for international staff of humanitarian organisations working in occupied Palestinian territories, which has hampered efforts to get food and other vital supplies into Gaza. Dozens of foreign aid workers, including heads of organisations, have had to leave Israel and the Palestinian territories, or are overstaying their visas and risking deportation so they can continue working. Emergency response teams are particularly affected, and the visa block means aid groups have not been able to bring any experts into Jerusalem, from where most aid to Gaza is coordinated.
