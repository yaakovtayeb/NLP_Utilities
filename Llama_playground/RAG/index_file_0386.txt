What is the case launched by South Africa against Israel at the International Court of Justice (ICJ)? 

At 2023-dec-29, south Africa has launched a case at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) accusing Israel of “genocidal” acts in Gaza. Israel responded to the allegations “with disgust”, calling South Africa’s case a “blood libel” and urging the ICJ to reject it. Any case at the ICJ is likely to take years to resolve, but South Africa has called for the court to convene in the next few days to issue “provisional measures” calling for a ceasefire.
