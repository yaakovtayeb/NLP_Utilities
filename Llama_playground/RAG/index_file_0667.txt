What is Israel's plan for a ground offensive into Gaza, and why do they believe it is necessary?

At 2023-oct-19, israel's security officials have signaled their readiness to embark on a ground offensive into Gaza that they say will be far more comprehensive and ferocious than any previous conflict with Hamas. They argue that they have no choice but to launch a massive assault, codenamed Operation Swords of Iron, to eliminate Hamas from the roots, not only militarily, but also economically, its administration. They warn that it won't be clear cut and it won't be as short as Israelis would like, and it will be a prolonged campaign that will take time.
