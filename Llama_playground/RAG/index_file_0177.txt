What is the controversy surrounding Israel's participation in the Eurovision song contest?

At 2024-mar-11, israel's participation in the Eurovision song contest has been controversial due to the country's actions in Gaza and the EBU's perceived double standards in defining what counts as "political". The EBU has faced pressure from musicians and an online petition to ban Israel from competing, but the country was ultimately allowed to participate after changing the lyrics of its entry. Many Eurovision fans have called for a boycott of the contest in response.
