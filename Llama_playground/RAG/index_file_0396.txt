What is the current situation in Gaza and what is being done to address the humanitarian crisis?

At 2023-dec-22, israel is expanding its ground offensive in Gaza, causing widespread displacement, destruction, and suffering. Negotiations for a UN Security Council resolution to increase the flow of humanitarian supplies have been delayed by disagreements over wording, but an amended version has been proposed that appeals for urgent steps to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access. However, it is unclear whether the resolution will pass and whether it will be enough to address the scale of the crisis. Meanwhile, talks on a ceasefire are ongoing in Cairo, but there is little hope of an immediate breakthrough.
