What is the disinformation being spread online regarding the Israel-Hamas conflict?

At 2023-oct-11, since Hamas launched an attack on Israel, X has been flooded with disinformation and misinformation that has heightened tensions across the globe. Disinformation refers to the deliberate spread of false information, while misinformation is when someone unwittingly spreads or believes the false information to be true. Examples include a video that claims to show high-profile Israeli generals captured by Hamas fighters, a doctored document suggesting that Joe Biden gave $8bn in assistance to Israel, and a fake video purporting to be from the BBC that claimed to feature a Bellingcat investigation showing Ukraine smuggled weapons to Hamas.
