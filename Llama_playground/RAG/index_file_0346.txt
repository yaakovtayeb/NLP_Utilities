What are the possible consequences of the US and UK military strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen?

At 2024-jan-13, the possible consequences of the US and UK military strikes on Houthi bases in Yemen are all the more alarming because they are unknowable and unpredictable. The US and Britain may be getting themselves into an open-ended shooting war they cannot win, and their action is essentially futile. The Houthis have vowed to retaliate, and they can count on unstinting support from their main ally, Iran. Uncontrolled escalation, sparking a wider conflict, has been a constant fear since the Israel-Hamas war began.
