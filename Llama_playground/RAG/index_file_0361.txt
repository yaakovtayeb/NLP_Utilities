What is the likelihood of a major war in the Middle East, and what is the role of Iran and its proxy forces in this situation?

At 2024-jan-06, the likelihood of a major war in the Middle East is increasing due to the daily drone strikes, assassinations, and maritime assaults. Iran's unclear intentions and contested degree of control over its numerous linked but autonomous groups are also contributing factors. Iran uses its "axis of resistance" to make up for its lack of regional diplomatic clout. However, the degree of autonomy these groups enjoy is heavily contested. Some see the groups as mere appendages or puppets of Iran, while others say this denies history, agency, and the organic reasons the groups came into existence.
