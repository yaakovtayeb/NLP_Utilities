What is the main argument presented in the letter regarding Israel's strategy in the Israel-Hamas war?

At 2023-nov-05, the letter argues that Israel's strategy of bombing and ground offensive into Gaza will not achieve its stated aim of "destroying Hamas" and will instead fuel Palestinian hatred and despair, inevitably creating a new generation of Hamas terrorists. The only way for Israel to establish lasting security is by heeding the voices that call for moderation, stopping the violence and holding bilateral talks towards mutual understanding and toleration â€“ as per the UN two-state policy.
