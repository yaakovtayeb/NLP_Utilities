What caused the heavy rains and floods in Greece and Libya in September 2020, and what factors contributed to turning the extreme weather into a humanitarian disaster?

At 2023-sep-19, carbon pollution caused by human activities, particularly burning fossil fuels, led to heavier rains and stronger floods in Greece and Libya in September 2020. Global heating made the levels of rainfall that devastated the Mediterranean up to 50 times more likely in Libya and up to 10 times more likely in Greece. However, other human factors such as building homes on floodplains, chopping down trees, and not maintaining dams contributed to turning the extreme weather into a humanitarian disaster. The ongoing conflict and political instability in Libya compounded the effects of the flooding, and changes to the landscape made the Greek floods more damaging.
