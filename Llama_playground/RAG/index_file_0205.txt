What is the US' stance on the Israeli military occupation of Gaza and its conflict with Palestine, and what leverage does President Biden have over Israel? 

At 2024-feb-28, the US has provided unconditional support to Israel and has used its veto power to protect it from UN resolutions calling for an immediate ceasefire. President Biden has significant leverage over Israel, including the ability to cut off its supply of bombs and military aid, but has not used it to force Netanyahu to accept a permanent ceasefire.
