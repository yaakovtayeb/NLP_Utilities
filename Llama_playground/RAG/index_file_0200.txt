What happened in Geneina during the war in Sudan?

At 2024-feb-29, geneina witnessed two major massacres and more than 10,000 people died, mostly from the Masalit population. The city was convulsed by fighting that rapidly developed along tribal lines, pitting Masalit and other non-Arab people in support of the army against the RSF and allied Arab militia. Arab militias allied with the RSF laid siege to the city in May. On 15 June, the torture and murder of the Masalit governor of West Darfur state, Khamis Abbakar, allegedly by the RSF’s allies, prompted the exodus of thousands of people to Chad. By 22 June, the Darfur Bar Association reported that Geneina had fallen. There were further clashes in early November, which ended with the last remaining soldiers from the army garrison fleeing – marking the RSF’s final victory in the city.
