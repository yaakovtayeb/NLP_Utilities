What is the controversy surrounding Adania Shibli's novel Minor Detail and the Frankfurt Book Fair ceremony?

At 2023-oct-20, adania Shibli's novel Minor Detail, which tells the true story of an Israeli soldier's rape and murder of a Palestinian Bedouin girl, won Germany's 2023 LiBeraturpreis. However, due to criticism from some German journalists and politicians, the ceremony to honor Shibli at the Frankfurt Book Fair was postponed. This has led to accusations of Palestinian voices being silenced and a lack of empathy towards their perspectives.
