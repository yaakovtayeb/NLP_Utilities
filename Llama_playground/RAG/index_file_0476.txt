What is the significance of the Palestinian diaspora in Chile and how is Chile responding to the Gaza conflict? 

At 2023-nov-28, chile is home to the largest Palestinian diaspora outside the Middle East, numbering as many as 500,000 people. Chile has recognized Palestine as a state since 2011 and has full diplomatic relations with Israel, but the two embassies in Chile have no contact. Chilean politicians regularly spar over the conflict in the Middle East, which inflames passions even beyond the diaspora and extends into student politics. President Gabriel Boric’s foreign ministry announced last year that it planned to open an embassy in Palestine, although it gave no timeframe for the move. Then, this month, Boric recalled Chile’s ambassador from Tel Aviv, saying that Israel was not abiding by international law. Boric has condemned Hamas’s attacks on 7 October in which more than 1,200 people were killed, but he has also described the Israeli response, which has killed between 13,000 and 15,000 Palestinians, as “disproportionate”.
