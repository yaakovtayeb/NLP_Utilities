What is the US doing to help innocent Palestinians in Gaza amid the conflict with Israel?

At 2023-oct-15, the US is working actively to ensure Palestinian access to water, medicine, and food, and water had been turned back on to southern Gaza earlier Sunday. The US would continue to work with Israel, the UN, Egypt, Jordan, and aid groups to make sure innocent Palestinians would have access to basic necessities and "would be protected from bombardment."
