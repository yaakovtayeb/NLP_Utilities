What happened after the offensive by Hamas in Gaza, and what was the response of the Israeli government?

At 2023-oct-20, hours after the offensive by Hamas that left 1,400 Israelis dead, the Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, declared war on Hamas and issued a warning to Palestinians in Gaza to leave. Israel proceeded to unleash an unprecedented aerial assault, dropping 6,000 bombs on the densely populated enclave in the first five days alone. Then came the order: a directive for the 1.1 million people in northern Gaza to evacuate to the south within 24 hours.
