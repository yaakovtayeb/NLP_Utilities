Why did Troop 149 disband from Girl Scouts?

At 2024-mar-05, troop 149 decided to make and sell bracelets to donate the proceeds to the Palestine Childrenâ€™s Relief Fund, but after receiving a fierce response from their parent chapter, Girl Scouts of Eastern Missouri, they were faced with the difficult decision to either stop selling the bracelets or to disband from Girl Scouts entirely. They chose to disband and continue their noble cause.
