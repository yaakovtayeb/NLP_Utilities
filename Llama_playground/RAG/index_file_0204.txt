What is the current status of negotiations between Hamas and Israel, and what is the proposed framework for a ceasefire?

At 2024-feb-28, hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh stated that the group is showing flexibility in the negotiations with Israel, but they are ready to continue fighting. The two sides have been negotiating around a draft framework that would reportedly see a six-week pause in fighting and the release of hostages held in captivity by Hamas for Palestinians who have been detained by Israel.
