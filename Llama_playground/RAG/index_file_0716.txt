What was the response of the Israeli government to the terror attack by Hamas and what has been the impact on Israeli society?

At 2023-oct-13, the Israeli government declared a full-scale war and established a national emergency government to run the war effort. Israelis have mobilized a sweeping volunteer effort to get donations of clothes, toys, blankets, food, and toiletries to people driven from their homes in the south. The attack has caused unity in crisis in Israeli society, but it is only a pause from the profound divisions in the society. The political ideology in Israel could lurch far to the right. Netanyahu's government has 64 seats out of 120 in parliament, with the most extreme politicians in its history. Right-wing ideology in Israeli terms extends to well over 70 members of parliament â€“ hardline, nationalist, militant and probably annexationist regarding the Palestinians.
