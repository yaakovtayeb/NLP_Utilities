What is the situation of British nationals in Gaza and what is the UK government doing to help them?

At 2023-oct-27, there are around 200 British or dual nationals in Gaza who are stuck due to the ongoing conflict and are seeking help from the UK government to evacuate them. The UK government has sent a team of Border Force officials to Egypt to help people leave, but there is no repatriation arrangement yet for those in Gaza.
