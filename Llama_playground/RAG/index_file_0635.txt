What is the likelihood of Hezbollah intervening in the fight against Israel in aid of Hamas?

At 2023-oct-25, the likelihood of escalation from Hezbollah is low as it does not need another “victory” to consolidate its position in the country, as it is comfortably the most powerful political actor in Lebanon. Nor will Iran want to sacrifice Hezbollah’s political gains for the sake of Hamas, as the Lebanese militant group’s role in aiding Iranian allies across the Arab world is key to Iran’s regional influence.
