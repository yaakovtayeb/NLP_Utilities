What is being done to care for the young children orphaned by the floods in Derna, Libya?

At 2023-sep-22, people in western Libya have started a campaign to collect breastmilk from women already breastfeeding their own children and distribute it to children whose mothers are dead or missing. Schools have been converted into shelters for children separated from their families. The ministry of social affairs is responsible for caring for orphaned children in the first instance and arranging their long-term care with foster families. Abdelnabi Abu Araba, a civil activist, said he had received nearly a thousand offers of foster care through his Facebook page and phone contacts.
