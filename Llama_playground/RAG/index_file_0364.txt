What are the policy proposals that Israeli officials are offering to appease the US regarding Gaza, and what is the US expecting from Netanyahu during Antony Blinken's visit to the Middle East?

At 2024-jan-05, israeli officials are offering a series of policy proposals on Gaza that lack detail or commitment, including keeping security control of Gaza but with an undefined, Israeli-guided Palestinian body running day-to-day administration and the US, the EU and regional partners taking responsibility for the reconstruction of the territory. The US is expecting Netanyahu to do more to protect civilians in Gaza, allow more aid to reach the territory and rein in outspoken far-right ministers who have called for the mass resettlement of Palestinians.
