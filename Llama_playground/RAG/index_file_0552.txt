What is the warning issued by the World Health Organization regarding the disease risk in Gaza?

At 2023-nov-08, the World Health Organization has warned of ‘worrying trends’ in the risk of disease in Gaza due to Israeli air bombardments that have disrupted the health system, access to clean water, and caused people to crowd in shelters. The lack of fuel in the densely populated enclave has caused desalination plants to shut down, which increases the risk of bacterial infections like diarrhoea spreading.
