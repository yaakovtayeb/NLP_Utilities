What is Israel's military strategy in the southern part of Gaza and how does it affect the humanitarian crisis in the area?

At 2023-dec-01, israel's military strategy in the southern part of Gaza is to divide it into numbered "evacuation areas" and conduct sequential, targeted bombing campaigns. The military aims to gradually take control of the area and destroy Hamas's military capability. However, this approach threatens to worsen the already dire humanitarian crisis in the crowded south, with an estimated 2 million people living there, half of whom were evacuated from the north. The new military approach risks pushing more people south around Rafah, increasing tensions between Israel and the international community, and causing further displacement of civilians inside Gaza.
