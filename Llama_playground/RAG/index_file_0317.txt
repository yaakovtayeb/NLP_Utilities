What is the current state of Western diplomacy and understanding of Yemen? 

At 2024-jan-20, western diplomats have been isolated and under-informed due to the highly secure nature of their embassies, which has resulted in limited information on the ground in Yemen. The UK and US have limited understanding of Yemen as a complex country due to the widely held view among western governments of Yemen as a security problem above all else. Additionally, Arabic language schools have shut down, and tourism has largely vanished, further isolating Westerners from Yemeni life.
